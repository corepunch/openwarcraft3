# OpenWarcraft Agent Guide

## Project Context

This codebase is inspired by **Quake 2** (id Software). The developer is deeply familiar with Quake 2's architecture and source code. **Quake 2 is the primary reference** for all lifecycle, state communication, UI control, movement, and entity patterns. Use **Quake 3** as a secondary reference for features Q2 lacks, such as client-side UI libraries or renderer module separation.

## Coding Style

- Follow the C coding style used in the Quake 2 source code (id Software style).
- Use the same patterns for module organization, data structures, and naming conventions as in Quake 2.
- Prefer simple, flat, and data-oriented design over complex object-oriented abstractions.
- Keep the code readable, compact, and close to the metal — minimize unnecessary indirection.
- **No hacks. No silent fallbacks. No hiding errors.** Every implementation must have a solid reasoning. If a shortcut is taken, mark it with `/* HACK: */` or `/* TODO: */` and explain *why* the proper fix is not yet possible. Never demote, drop, or silently skip unresolved data — instead, log it with `fprintf(stderr, ...)` so future debugging reveals the gap. Demotion (e.g. `FT_TEXTURE → FT_FRAME` for unresolved resources) hides the real problem; the resource should be found and resolved, not discarded. This rule extends to every stage of the rendering pipeline: when a resolved path fails to load (`R_LoadModel` returns NULL), loads the wrong type (not `ID_43DM`, missing `.m3`), or is dropped for any other reason, log it to `stderr` before the `continue`/`return` — do not silently discard. The same applies to map-load resolution failures (CTile, cliff, object models): log each unresolved item by name so the gap is visible in a bounded run without requiring a manual dump call.
- **Keep one representation for one shader concept.** Do not add zero-count modes, parallel fallback uniforms, or per-game exception branches when the normal array/struct path can represent the value. Add an exception only when the common representation is demonstrably impossible, and document that constraint at the branch.
- **Do not add fallbacks for behavior the authoritative data can resolve correctly.** Read the actual source of truth (MPQ/DBC files, map data, server tables, layout files, or format metadata) and fix the lifecycle or module boundary needed to consume it. For example, resolve an AzerothCore numeric map ID through the client `Map.dbc`; do not substitute a default map name, guess a path, or maintain a parallel hardcoded ID-to-name table. A fallback is acceptable only when the authoritative source genuinely lacks the value, and must be explicit, logged, and documented with the reason.
- **Never guess at a bug fix.** Before writing any fix, add targeted `fprintf(stderr, ...)` logs at the exact code paths in question, run the binary with `+com_frame_limit N` to capture a bounded log, read the output, and confirm the root cause from evidence. Only then write the fix and remove the logs. A fix written without log evidence is a guess and will be reverted. If the existing CLI tools (`mpqtool`, `dbctool`, `mdxtool`) cannot answer the question, extend them or add a new tool rather than guessing. The tools in `build/bin/` exist precisely because guessing at asset/data problems wastes time.
- **Never leave debug logs in production code.** The only `fprintf(stderr, ...)` calls that belong unconditionally in source are lifecycle messages ("loading map %s", "R_Init") and genuine errors/warnings. Investigative logs added while tracing a bug must be removed when the fix lands. If a log is still needed because the feature is in-progress, wrap it in `#ifdef <GAME>_DEBUG_<SYSTEM>` (e.g. `SC2_DEBUG_CUTSCENE`, `WC3_DEBUG_SLK`) so it is off by default and can be enabled without touching the code. Never commit bare per-call trace logs (e.g. printing every trigger fire, every unit order, every tile resolve) outside such a guard.
- **Use `git blame` when investigating history.** When a value, macro, or code path seems wrong, use `git blame` or `git log -p -S <pattern>` to find when and why it was introduced. The commit message and diff often explain the original intent, distinguishing a deliberate trade-off from an accidental value or copy-paste left-over.
- **Write as little code as possible.** Prefer smart tricks and reuse of existing code over writing new functions. When Quake code style leads to verbose vertical expansion, override it with denser, shorter forms: pack related statements on one line, use ternary/comma for conditional side effects, omit braces for single-statement bodies, and collapse trivial helpers into one-liners.
- For trusted binary game data, prefer memory-mapped/file-shaped structs with trailing arrays wherever possible. Read the blob, allocate/copy it as one block if ownership is needed, and point consumers at that struct instead of decoding, cropping, or post-processing into parallel runtime arrays.
- **Always use DDX-style schema tables to load structures from keyed, columnar, or tagged data** such as XML, FDF, catalogs, DBC, CSV, and chunked files. Define the grammar as data first (`{ name/column/tag, offsetof(struct, field), type, count/flags }`), then run one generic parser over it. Custom code is reserved for genuinely nested, repeated, versioned, or context-sensitive productions and must hang off the schema as a callback or explicit special production, not replace scalar field tables with `if`/`else` chains.
- **Table-to-Edict convention:** `edict_t` table pointer fields must match the exact SLK/DBC table name in PascalCase (e.g. `edict->ItemData`, `edict->UnitProfile`, `edict->UnitBalance`). Do not use lowerCamelCase aliases (`itemData`, `profile`). This enforces convention-over-configuration between table names, struct types (`ItemData_t`), `edict_t` fields (`ItemData`), and metadata macro entries (`M("iabi", ItemData, abilList, BZ_FIELD_CSTR)`).
- Use `bzFieldType_t` from `common/shared.h` for shared parser conversion/storage contracts. Keep pointer-valued `BZ_FIELD_CSTR` distinct from bounded inline `BZ_FIELD_CHAR_ARRAY`, and use explicit color channel-order types. Source readers still own byte order, token conversion, bounds, and accepted subsets. Shader descriptors follow the same table pattern but retain renderer-owned `uniformType_t`, because that enum specifies GLSL declarations and `glUniform*` ABI rather than file/text decoding.
- Prefer format-driven parsing when the data has a fixed syntax. Use `sscanf(text, "%f,%f,%f", ...)` instead of hand-writing character walkers, separator loops, and ad hoc token logic.
- Do not bury schema in manual `if`/`else` or `switch` ladders when a compact table can describe the same work. Treat descriptor tables as the parser grammar and single source of truth; adding an ordinary field should require one table entry, not a new branch.
- **Never write a `strcmp`/`strcasecmp` ladder to map a string to a value when a config table (array of `{ name, value }` structs + a lookup loop) could be used.** A table stays the single source of truth and can be shared across modules (e.g. `Wow_RaceNumber` in `games/world-of-warcraft/common/wow_character_utils.h`). Keep such tables in a game's `common/` header so renderer/game/ui all resolve the same mapping.
- **Always use FOURCC values for four-character tags/magics.** Never compare against raw four-char string literals (`Wow_TagEquals(tag, "TLOM")`, `memcmp(tag, "PGOM", 4)`). Define named constants with `MAKEFOURCC('T','L','O','M')` (or the reversed `ID_*` form in `common/shared.h`) at the top of the file or in the owning header, then compare `DWORD`-wise. Four-char literals are magic numbers in disguise: they scatter the same tag across modules and hide the endian/byte-order contract. When the on-disk tag is stored reversed (e.g. WoW chunk tags read as `"TLOM"` for `MOLT`), name the constant after the reversed bytes actually compared, or add a comment mapping it to the canonical tag.
- **Prefer designated struct initializers for aggregate values.** Initialize structs in one expression using `MAKE(type, .field = value, ...)` (or `(type){ .field = value, ... }`), including nested structs and arrays, instead of zero-initializing and assigning fields one by one. Leave omitted fields zero-initialized and preserve field names so the layout remains self-documenting.
- Do not use several booleans to represent mutually exclusive state. Define and pass an enum, then dispatch from that enum.
- Put pure, reusable local helpers in a small nearby utils header (e.g. `sc2_utils.h`) as `static` functions. Keep subsystem-owned helpers that touch globals or runtime state in the `.c` file that owns that state. Do not create a dedicated header for a single tiny helper — add it to the subsystem's existing shared header (e.g. `r_local.h`, `g_local.h`) instead.
- Follow a strict DRY rule: do not duplicate logic or repeat the same data literal in multiple places.
- When a transform is applied per-component (RGB/XYZ), run it in a loop over the components or through a small transform macro instead of copy-pasting N near-identical statements. Prefer operating on a whole struct/vector (`vec3`/`COLOR32`) over its individual fields (`x`,`y`,`z`); drop to per-field code only when the fields genuinely differ.
- **Always reach for the `shared/` math library first.** Before writing inline matrix/vector/quaternion math, check whether `Vector3_*`, `Matrix4_*`, or `Quaternion_*` already covers the operation. When a needed utility is missing (e.g. `Vector3_clamp01`), add it to the appropriate `shared/types/` header and `shared/source/` implementation rather than writing a one-off local function — the shared library is the canonical home for reusable math.
- Keep runtime structs concise. Group related fields; use anonymous structs for repeated shapes; prefer `DWORD flags` over many standalone `BOOL` fields.
- Declare a pointer + element-count pair as one unit with `ARRAY(type, name)` (defines `type *name; DWORD name##_count;`). Access the count via `ARRAY_COUNT(name)`, test emptiness with `IS_ARRAY_EMPTY(name)` (checks both pointer and count), and iterate with `FOR_EACH_ARRAY(type, it, name)` — or `FOR_LOOP(i, ARRAY_COUNT(name))` when the index is needed — never read or write `name##_count` directly.
- Keep schema and field tables in a single column: put one descriptor or field entry on each line so the table is easy to scan and compare with its corresponding struct. Keep array entries on separate lines too, except for arrays of numbers or other genuinely short entries where a compact row remains clearer.
- In C source files, declare all file-scope types and arrays before function definitions; keep the function implementations below those declarations.
- Test flag membership with implicit bool conversion: `flags & FLAG` not `(flags & FLAG) != 0`.
- Use `snake_case` for functions and variables, `ALL_CAPS` for constants and macros, matching Quake 2 conventions.
- Use the `BZ_` prefix for project-private compile-time macros, generated binding helpers, environment toggles, and namespaced constants.
- When fixing warnings for short, future-facing hooks (one-line static moves, extern declarations, placeholder assignments), prefer commenting them out over deleting them. Add a short comment explaining the warning and when the line should come back.
- For WoW UI code (`games/world-of-warcraft/menu/`), do not fail silently. Emit a clear `UIWow:` log when a required script, handler, renderer resource, or fallback path is missing.
- When a function has more than 3 parameters, group them into a dedicated input struct (`draw<Thing>_t` or `<thing>Params_t`).

## General Formatting

- Minimize vertical space. Prefer fewer, denser lines over many short ones.
- Keep C source lines at or under 120 characters.
- Keep function calls on one physical line; never split their argument lists across lines. Keep arguments short enough to make this practical, accepting a line longer than 120 characters when necessary.
- Prefer variable and field names of 8 characters or fewer; use a shorter 4-character name when it remains clear (`cur`, `old`, `rot`, `scl`). Preserve externally defined API and on-disk schema names when the spelling is part of that contract.
- When adjacent declarations share a type and can be packed without obscuring initialization, declare them on one line (`m2PoseTime_t cur, old;`).
- Single-statement functions go on one line: `int f(void) { return 0; }`
- Omit braces for single-statement `if`/`else`/`while` bodies.
- Keep control-flow keywords at the start of their own line. Do not write chained forms like `...; if (...)` on the same physical line.
- Add a short comment before each non-trivial function describing why it exists — the constraint or contract that isn't obvious from the signature alone.
- Add a trailing `//` comment to every numeric `#define`. State the units, the specific reason for the value, and what it controls. Format: `#define NAME VALUE // units; why this value; used as ...`. Bare names are never self-documenting for magic numbers — a reader should not have to grep callers to understand what `0.15f` or `24` means.
- When changing a constant's value, update its trailing comment to explain why the value changed — what measurement, constraint, or incident forced the new value. The comment must reflect the current value, not the old one.
- For any fallback, workaround, or partial implementation, prepend `/* HACK: */` or `/* TODO: */` and explain why.
- Extract grass rendering tuning and schema values into named `WOW_GRASS_*` defines at the top of the WoW renderer header; do not leave grass literals in generation code or hardcode asset/material values when MPQ data provides them.
- When providing a bug fix, add an inline comment at the fix site explaining why the fix is correct and what the original behaviour was.

- Struct names are ALL CAPS, short, and descriptive (e.g., `PORTRAITFOG`). No `_t` suffix.
- Use WinAPI-style `LP`/`LPC` typedefs for struct pointer types (`LPCPORTRAITDEF`, `LPRECT`).
- `LP` = long pointer (non-const), `LPC` = long pointer to const.
- Define both alongside the struct using separate `typedef` lines so `LPC` is `const struct *`.

## What to Avoid

- **Do not patch loaded UI layout in code.** SC2Layout and FDF files define the correct layout. When a panel's anchors seem wrong (e.g. off-screen positioning from a cross-panel reference), fix the anchor resolution in the layout system so it handles the case correctly — don't override anchors per-panel in game code. The layout data is authoritative; code must apply it faithfully.
- **Never duplicate a game's UI layout in C.** All geometry — positions, sizes, anchors — belongs in the game's own layout files: FDF for WC3, FrameXML for WoW, SC2Layout for SC2. For WC3: load the relevant FDF from the MPQ via `UI_EnsureFDF`, generate a binding header with `fdfbindgen`, and fill runtime data (textures, text, click handlers, visibility) into the parsed frame tree. Do **not** write project-owned FDF files in `share/UI/FrameDef/` — if a frame exists in War3.mpq, bind to the War3 original; if the frame type is native (portrait, command button, minimap, tooltip) and has no FDF definition in the MPQ, construct it in C with a static `FRAMEDEF`, `UI_InitFrame`, `UI_SetSize`, and `UI_SetPoint` using inline float literals. Do not declare named `#define` position constants for these inline values.
- **Do not ship project-owned WoW FrameXML.** Load the authoritative XML/Lua and inherited templates from WoW archives. If classic WoW creates presentation outside FrameXML, reproduce that runtime construction instead of authoring a parallel XML file under `share/Interface/FrameXML/`. Test fixtures may mirror native files under their original Blizzard paths; production may not load those fixtures or `OpenWarcraft*.xml` substitutes.
  **`UI_SetPoint` Y sign convention:** `UI_CopyFrameBase` encodes Y offsets without negation; the client negates them on decode. This matches WC3 FDF convention where positive Y = upward. To position a frame *below* a TOPLEFT anchor, pass a **negative** Y: `UI_SetPoint(f, FRAMEPOINT_TOPLEFT, NULL, FRAMEPOINT_TOPLEFT, x, -y_from_top)`. Passing positive Y for a downward displacement places the frame above the screen.
- Do not introduce helper variables just to name an intermediate result if the expression is already readable inline.
- Do not add blank lines between short, related statements.
- Do not split a declaration and its first assignment onto separate lines.
- Do not add null-pointer or function-pointer guards before calling cross-module API functions (`ui.*`, `re.*`, `s.*`, etc.). These are guaranteed to be set at init time.
- Treat every cross-module API entry point as mandatory. Call `ui.*`, `re.*`, `s.*`, and game/server import callbacks directly; never add `if (api.Func)` guards that mask an incomplete API table or hide an initialization bug. Do not introduce generic named-command callbacks such as `GameCommand`; use a dedicated numbered `svc_*` message and typed handler for each protocol event.

## WC3 UI Tooling — fdfbindgen

The `fdfbindgen` tool (built at `build/bin/fdfbindgen`) reads one or more FDF files and emits a C header that maps every named frame to a typed struct field. The generated headers live in two locations:

- `games/warcraft-3/menu/generated/` — screen-level frames used by the menu/glue layer (`ui/screens/*.c`).
- `games/warcraft-3/game/generated/` — in-game HUD frames used by `game/hud/*.c`.

**When to regenerate:** any time you add, rename, or remove a named frame in an FDF file that already has a corresponding generated header, run fdfbindgen to keep the header in sync. Do not edit generated headers by hand.

**How to run — glue/menu header from MPQ:**
```
mpqtool -mpq War3.mpq cat UI/FrameDef/Glue/MainMenu.fdf \
  | build/bin/fdfbindgen -prefix MainMenu -root MainMenuFrame \
      -load UI\\FrameDef\\Glue\\MainMenu.fdf - \
  > games/warcraft-3/menu/generated/main_menu.h
```

**How to run — in-game HUD header from MPQ:**
```
mpqtool -mpq War3.mpq cat UI/FrameDef/UI/InfoPanelBuildingDetail.fdf \
  | build/bin/fdfbindgen -prefix InfoPanelBuildingDetail -root InfoPanelBuildingDetail \
      -load UI\\FrameDef\\UI\\InfoPanelTemplates.fdf \
      -load UI\\FrameDef\\UI\\InfoPanelBuildingDetail.fdf - \
  > games/warcraft-3/game/generated/info_panel_building_detail.h
```

All generated headers bind directly to frames parsed from War3.mpq FDF files. Do not generate headers from project-owned FDF files — there are none; use C code instead for frames that have no MPQ equivalent.

Key flags: `-prefix <Name>` sets the struct and function prefix; `-root <FrameName>` selects which top-level frame becomes the binding root; `-optional-root <FrameName>` adds an additional root that is allowed to be absent; `-optional-children` suppresses missing-child errors for frames that may not appear in all archive variants (e.g. TFT-only frames).

## Tool Failures

- **If a tool fails repeatedly, stop and notify the user.** When a tool fails more than 2-3 times with the same error, do not keep retrying blindly. Inform the user what is failing and why, propose a workaround, and ask whether to continue or wait for help.

## Test Discipline

- Verify every Warcraft III data/UI change in both ROC (default archives) and TFT (`-tft`). TFT archives override ROC
  paths and may replace whole FDF/string/data files rather than extending them, so confirm both variants explicitly.

- **Every structural change must include or update tests.** When you add a function, change a behavior path, fix a bug, or modify a struct/API contract, check whether existing tests cover the change.
- **Audit every WC3 `edict_t` field against save/load.** Any field added, removed, moved, or retyped in `games/warcraft-3/game/g_local.h` must update the persistence contract in `games/warcraft-3/game/g_save.c` in the same change. Plain value fields are retained by the raw `edict_t` record; entity/client pointers must use a stable `fields[]` fixup, and process-owned pointers must be cleared and rebuilt explicitly. Add a focused ROC/TFT round-trip test for the field and an invalid-reference test when applicable; never rely only on the save header's `sizeof(edict_t)` check.
- **Engine/game-boundary diff check:** Before finishing any diff that touches `client/`, `common/`, `renderer/`, or
  `server/`, check the diff for two things: (1) any new enum member, macro, or struct field whose name contains a
  race/faction/unit/spell/franchise-specific proper noun, and (2) any new `#ifdef <GAME>` guard or hardcoded
  per-game command string added to a function that previously had none. Either one means the change belongs in
  `games/<game>/` instead — route it through the shared dispatcher's existing function-table hook (or add one)
  rather than branching inline. See [docs/architecture/server-selected-effects.md](docs/architecture/server-selected-effects.md)
  for the reference pattern and worked examples of these mistakes and their fixes.
- **New code paths need new tests.** If you add an `if` branch, a new function, a new field, or a new cache/state machine, write a test for the new path and its inverse.
- **Cache/state-machine changes double-test.** Test both cache hit and cache miss paths, and verify performance counters where tracked.
- **Run `make test` before committing.** This umbrella target runs all test binaries: `test_openwarcraft3` (net + tool_common), `test-commands`, `test-server-net`, `test-sc2`, `test-wow-*`, `test-ui`, and `test-wc3-engine` (in-engine WC3 tests).
- **In-engine WC3 tests** live in `games/warcraft-3/game/tests/` and run inside the real game binary against live archives via `make test-wc3-engine` (or `+dedicated 1 +test '*'`). They cover 9 suites: `t_slk`, `t_unit`, `t_movement`, `t_pathfinding`, `t_collision`, `t_game`, `t_combat`, `t_api`, `t_smoke`.
- **In-engine WoW tests** run headlessly via `make test-wow-engine` (or `$(openwow-tests) +dedicated 1 +test '*'`). Standalone WoW tests (no game deps) run via `make test-wow-appearances/abilities/game/entities/ui`.
- **Compile and run tests before finishing any work.** Build and run the affected game target with a bounded frame limit
  (`make run-wow` or `make run-sc2` as appropriate; for WC3 follow the ROC/TFT rule above), then run `make test`.
  Shared-renderer changes must build and run every game whose renderer path changed. Never mark work complete without a
  green test run.
- **Runtime validation must exercise the changed behavior.** Launch the actual game mode, connect/load a map, and issue the
  command or action that drives the modified client/server path. A successful main-menu startup does not validate gameplay
  networking because no client is connected to a game server there. For UI work, send/open the changed panel and capture a
  frame showing it; for Quest/Log windows, load a WC3 map and issue `quests`/`log` after the connection reaches `ca_active`.
- **Auto-quit the app with `+com_frame_limit N`.** When running a game for verification, pass `+com_frame_limit 100`
  (or similar) so it exits without manual intervention. Example: `make run-wow ARGS="+com_frame_limit 100"`.
- **`git blame` before changing existing struct/API fields.** Understand why a field exists and what trade-offs were made before changing it.
- **Do not disable a failing test.** Fix the code or fix the test — do not comment it out, add `SKIP`, or reduce its coverage.
- **"Pre-existing" failures and warnings are not an excuse.** If `make test` shows failures, fix them. Remove dead dispatchers still calling old harness macros (e.g., `RUN_TEST` in migrated suites), unwrap mock callbacks accidentally wrapped in `TEST()`, and ensure test fixtures are complete (e.g., load GlobalStrings.fdf when tests resolve string-table keys). If the build emits warnings in code you encounter during a task — even in files you did not change — fix them before finishing. A warning that was there before your change is still your responsibility to remove when you touch the surrounding code or discover it during a build.
- **Keep test assertions in sync with content.** When you update action bar names, inventory names, UI strings, or any other literal values the game writes to clients, update the matching `T_STREQ`/`T_EQ` assertions in the test suite immediately. A test that checks a stale string is a silent gap, not a passing test. Do not declare a task finished if `make test` shows any failures — find the root cause and fix it.

## Architecture

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for the full engine/game boundary, module structure, network state contracts, engine struct/API discipline, and UI rendering overview.

Key principles inline:
- Runtime modules communicate through function tables (`R_GetAPI`, `M_GetAPI`, game imports/exports).
- The server controls what the client draws via state bits in `playerState_t`. The client just reads them.
- Never hardcode game-specific asset names, animation names, or franchise-specific literals in engine code —
  including enum members, macros, and struct field names in `common/`, `renderer/`, `client/`, `server/`.
  A named boolean for one race/unit/spell (e.g. `RF_BUILDING_FIRE_UNDEAD`) does not belong in a shared enum
  even though the flags field itself is generic infrastructure. Test: if a symbol you're adding to a
  non-`games/` path contains a proper noun from one game's fiction, stop — move the resolution into
  `games/<game>/` and expose a generic field instead.
- Never use `#ifdef SC2`/`#ifdef WOW`/`#ifdef WC3` (or any per-game macro) to gate *any* code in shared engine
  files (`client/`, `common/`, `renderer/`, `server/`) — not just constants, but branches, command handlers,
  and logic blocks too. If code only matters for one game, it belongs in `games/<game>/`, reached through the
  existing function-table/vtable boundary (`ui.*`, `re.*`, `gi.*`/`ge.*`, or a new table entry if none exists).
  A shared dispatcher should stay entirely game-agnostic even when only one game currently drives it — other
  games simply never send that command, which is already harmless without a compile guard. Per-game constants
  live in `games/*/common/ui_constants.h` and resolve via the per-game `-I` include path.
- **Never widen `entityState_t` or `playerState_t` without asking.** These structs are network contracts — every byte change affects bandwidth, delta compression, and snapshot size. If you need more data in the entity state, discuss with the developer first. Use existing fields, renderer-side caches, or DBC lookups instead.

## Server-Authoring Pattern (Quake 2 STAT_LAYOUTS)

- `uiflags` bitmask hides layout layers: each bit corresponds to a `UILAYOUTLAYER` value. Server sets bits to hide layers, client checks `(1 << layer) & uiflags`.
- `client_ui_state` enum (`CLIENT_UI_GAME`, `CLIENT_UI_LOADING`, `CLIENT_UI_CINEMATIC`) controls broad client modes.
- Never hardcode game-mode-specific skip logic in the client. The server sets the appropriate flags; the client respects them.

## Mouse Input Architecture

- Mouse state is owned by the client: the `mouse` global (`mouseEvent_t` in `client/cl_input.c`) is the single source of truth.
- The UI library receives mouse events via `menu.MouseEvent(x, y, button, down)` — push-based, called during `SDL_PollEvent` in `CL_Input()`.
- Game-mode-specific mouse behavior lives in per-game `cl_input_<game>.c` files via the `CL_InputMode*` functions.
- Never create a separate mouse state struct in game UI code. Never poll mouse event state during draw.

## UI Module Boundary

- **Never use `menu module` for in-game UI.** `menu module` is reserved for the main menu/glue screens and may be unloaded in the future while a game is loading. In-game UI state, input, presentation, and client-owned gameplay widgets belong in `client/`. Use commit `611e3bbb` (`refactor: centralize generic minimap handling`) as the reference implementation for this ownership model.
- Keep `menu module` focused on loading screens and menu/glue UI. New in-game HUD presentation must be server-authored through
  `svc_layout`; the generic client may bind declared frames to already-replicated `playerState_t`, `entityState_t`, and configstring
  data, but `menu module` must not independently construct or populate gameplay HUD widgets.
- An in-game `menu module` exception is allowed only when `svc_layout`, replicated state/configstrings, and generic client layout bindings
  demonstrably cannot represent the feature. Mark the implementation at the call site with `/* HACK: */` and explain that specific
  constraint. Convenience, per-game styling, or client-local mouse/projection state are not sufficient reasons for an exception.
- Do not add UI import callbacks for mouse polling, loading state polling, layout decoding, or map-info helpers. Use pushed events, `DrawLoadingScreen(map, status, progress)`, client-owned layout functions, and direct `CM_*` calls inside the UI module.
- Loading-screen ownership stays with `ca_loading`. The client may only enter `ca_active` from `CL_PrepRefresh()` after all required assets are registered.

See [docs/ui-authoring.md](docs/ui-authoring.md) for FDF conventions, screen controller patterns, ConsoleUI, and stb_fdf.h.

## Missing Asset Placeholders

Follow Quake 2's pattern. Never fail silently, never crash, never log per-frame.

- **Registration always returns a valid handle.** `R_LoadTexture` returns `tr.texture[TEX_PLACEHOLDER]` on file-not-found. `R_LoadModel` returns an empty zeroed `model_t`. Callers never get NULL.
- **Log once per unique asset.** Use a static `last_missing` pointer to suppress repeated warnings for the same filename.
- **Cache the result.** Higher-level caches store the placeholder handle just like a successful load.
- **Do not add per-frame or per-draw warnings.**
- **Do not add local null-check guards for textures returned by `R_LoadTexture`.** The function guarantees a valid pointer.

## Command Conventions

- **Fast-forward bounded simulations explicitly.** `com_frame_limit` counts main-loop iterations, not 10 Hz server ticks. For AI and other long simulation diagnostics, pass `-com_fast_forward` (or `+set com_fast_forward 1`) together with `+com_frame_limit N`; each loop then advances one fixed `FRAMETIME` (100 ms) server tick without wall-clock pacing. Example: `build/bin/openwarcraft3 -data 'data/Warcraft III' -roc -com_fast_forward +map 'Maps/(2)Rivercross.w3m' +com_frame_limit 10000`. Do not use fast-forward for rendering, input, networking, or frame-pacing validation.
- **SDL display modes are opt-in diagnostics.** Pass `-vid_modes` (or `+set vid_modes 1`) to log the available SDL display modes during renderer startup; normal startup omits the list. This works in WC3, WoW and SC2 and is not saved automatically. Plural `vid_modes` controls logging; singular `vid_mode` selects resolution. See [video modes](docs/build-and-renderer-platforms.md#video-modes).
- The `+` prefix (e.g. `+map`, `+menu_main`) is for **command-line arguments only**. It tells `Cbuf_AddLateCommands` to strip the `+` and queue the command for startup execution.
- In code, use the bare command name when calling `Cbuf_AddText` or `mi.Cmd_ExecuteText`: `"map ..."` not `"+map ..."`.
- **Launch UI scenes directly** with a `+menu_<scene>` late command — there is no `+ui` command. Scene names come from the `menu_*` commands each game registers via `Cmd_AddCommand` in its `menu_main.c`: WC3 (`menu_main`, `menu_options`, ...) and WoW (`menu_login`, `menu_character_select`, `menu_character_create`, `menu_ingame`). Examples: `build/bin/openwarcraft3 -data 'data/Warcraft III' +menu_main`, `build/bin/openwow -data data/world-of-warcraft +menu_character_create`. See [docs/rendering-scene-workflow.md](docs/rendering-scene-workflow.md).
- **Use the engine screenshot command, not desktop capture.** `screenshot` writes `screenshots/shotNNNN.jpg` (JPEG, quality 90). `screenshot N` captures the Nth fully rendered frame after the command executes. From the command line, place it after the map selector and keep `com_frame_limit` larger than the delay:
  ```
  build/bin/opensc2 -data data/StarCraft2 +map Maps/TerranTest.SC2Components +vid_hidden 1 +screenshot 5 +com_frame_limit 10
  make run-sc2 ARGS="+map Maps/TerranTest.SC2Components +vid_hidden 1 +screenshot 5 +com_frame_limit 10"
  ```
  Do **not** remove existing screenshots before running — just read the highest-numbered file after the run. Read the JPEG with the `Read` tool and compare it visually against the reference image before reporting the task done. A black or empty frame means the renderer did not reach the game loop; increase `com_frame_limit` or reduce `screenshot N`.
- **Project-owned config/data layout.** Read-only game defaults ship in `games/<game>/share/config.cfg`, installed to `build/share/<game>/` by `make install-share` (a dependency of `make build` and every `run`/`build-run` target). Engine-wide assets (`fonts/`) stay in `share/`. Writable user state (`config.cfg`, `autoexec.cfg`, `characters.xml`) resolves to `~/.<game>/` on Unix and `%APPDATA%\<game>\` on Windows, falling back to `share/<game>/` when `$HOME` is unavailable. The game name is the `BZ_GAME` define in each `games/*/game.mk` (`warcraft-3`, `world-of-warcraft`, `starcraft-2`); resolve it with `FS_BasePath()` / `FS_HomePath()` / `FS_UserPath()` in `common/common.c`, or the `fs_basepath`/`fs_homepath` cvars. See [docs/architecture/runtime.md](docs/architecture/runtime.md).

## Domain

- This is a **real-time strategy game** (RTS), so game logic should account for unit management, pathfinding, resource gathering, building construction, and large numbers of entities — adapted from the Quake 2/3 entity/server model where applicable.

## Documentation Discipline

- **Documentation is part of the task, not optional cleanup.** Any fact that required looking through code, authoritative game data,
  runtime logs, history, issues/PRs, or external references must be written into reusable agent-facing documentation before finishing.
- Capture the answer a future agent would otherwise have to reconstruct: ownership and data flow, schema/field meanings, defaults and
  sentinels, lookup chains, version differences, exact diagnostic commands, confirmed root cause, and misleading approaches to avoid.
- When implementing or changing a feature, add or adjust agent-friendly documentation if the change introduces a new workflow, tool,
  convention, subsystem, or non-obvious constraint.
- Put durable documentation under `docs/`: shared workflows at `docs/`, engine architecture at `docs/architecture/`, and game-specific material at `docs/games/<game>/`.
- Keep AGENTS.md as a concise index and rule set. Detailed workflows and reference material belong in dedicated files.
- Keep documentation concise and actionable — prefer command examples and file paths over prose.
- **Populate docs as you go.** Do not leave findings only in conversation context, terminal output, or code comments. If no document
  exists for the subsystem, create one.
- Add every new dedicated document to the nearest table of contents (`AGENTS.md`, a game `readme.md`, or an architecture index) and add
  cross-links from adjacent workflow/reference documents when that makes the knowledge easier to find.
- Follow [docs/documentation-guide.md](docs/documentation-guide.md) for what to capture, where to put it, and the completion checklist.
- **Before finishing any diff that touches `common/`, `renderer/`, `client/`, or `server/`**, re-read every
  new enum member, macro, and struct field you added. If any symbol name contains a race, faction, unit, or
  spell name from a specific game's fiction, stop and move it into `games/<game>/` — see
  [docs/architecture/server-selected-effects.md](docs/architecture/server-selected-effects.md).

## GitHub Issues

- Before creating a GitHub issue, check available labels with `gh label list`.
- When creating issues, assign appropriate labels (e.g. `enhancement`, `warcraft-3`, `world-of-warcraft`, `renderer`, `ui`).
- If a needed label doesn't exist, create it first with `gh label create`.
- Keep issue titles at most 80 characters.
- Keep issues scoped to one game/title when possible.
