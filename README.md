# OpenWarcraft3

OpenWarcraft3 is an open-source, Quake-style engine and compatibility project for Blizzard-era game data. Warcraft III is the primary playable target; StarCraft II and World of Warcraft provide additional format and renderer targets.

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](LICENSE) [![CI](https://github.com/corepunch/open-realm/actions/workflows/c-cpp.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/corepunch/open-realm/actions/workflows/c-cpp.yml)

The project does not include retail game data. Use it only with data you legally own. OpenWarcraft3 is not affiliated with Blizzard Entertainment.

## Current targets

- **Warcraft III** — `openwarcraft3`, the main development target, including the client/server runtime, JASS, SLK/profile data, FDF UI, campaign flow, maps, fog, units, and networking.
- **World of Warcraft** — `openwow`, an exploratory M2/WMO/DBC/MPQ and UI target with a Lua-backed interface.
- **StarCraft II** — `opensc2`, an exploratory M3/SC2Map/SC2Layout target.

The shared runtime contains the client, server, renderer backend, networking, archive loading, console/cvars, sound, and math libraries. Game-specific code lives under `games/<game>/` and is connected through Quake 2-style import/export tables.

## Download

Pre-built binaries and Flatpak bundles are available from the [latest release](https://github.com/corepunch/open-realm/releases/latest). CI artifacts are published by the [C/C++ workflow](https://github.com/corepunch/open-realm/actions/workflows/c-cpp.yml). Neither releases nor CI artifacts contain retail assets.

For Flatpak and Steam Deck packaging, see [Flatpak And Steam Deck Packaging](docs/flatpak-steam-deck.md).

## Build

The native build requires a C compiler, `make`, SDL2, and system OpenGL (or GLES3 on supported Linux systems). MPQ loading and most format tooling are provided by vendored or in-tree code.

macOS:

```bash
brew install sdl2
```

Ubuntu/Debian:

```bash
sudo apt-get install build-essential libsdl2-dev
```

Windows builds use MSYS2/MinGW or Visual Studio with SDL2 development libraries.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/corepunch/open-realm.git
cd open-realm
make build
```

Useful targets:

```bash
make openwarcraft3       # Warcraft III executable
make openwow             # World of Warcraft executable
make opensc2             # StarCraft II executable
make tools               # Asset/archive diagnostic tools
make test                # Generate fixtures and run tests
make test-ui             # Warcraft III UI parser/layout tests
```

The default build is diagnostic. Select release mode and renderer settings with:

```bash
make clean && make BUILD=release openwarcraft3
make clean && make BUILD=release GL_BACKEND=gles3 MSAA=0 openwarcraft3
```

Supported settings are `BUILD=debug|release`, `GL_BACKEND=gl|gles3`, `MSAA=0|2|4|8`, and `GLSL=120|140|150`. Run `make clean` when changing these values. See [Build And Renderer Platforms](docs/build-and-renderer-platforms.md).

## Run with game data

Point the executable at a Warcraft III installation containing its MPQ archives:

```bash
build/bin/openwarcraft3 -data "/path/to/Warcraft III"
```

The directory is scanned for top-level MPQs and an optional loose `Maps/` directory. The Makefile also supports `WC3DATA`:

```bash
WC3DATA="/path/to/Warcraft III" make run
```

Useful examples:

```bash
build/bin/openwarcraft3 -data "/path/to/Warcraft III" +menu_main
build/bin/openwarcraft3 -data "/path/to/Warcraft III" +map 'Maps/Campaign/Orc01.w3m'
build/bin/openwarcraft3 -data "/path/to/Warcraft III" -vid_modes +com_frame_limit 10
```

Open the in-game Quake-style console with backtick/tilde. Use `build/bin/mpqtool` to inspect archives:

```bash
build/bin/mpqtool -mpq "/path/to/Warcraft III/War3.mpq" ls Maps/Campaign
```

## Tests and diagnostics

`make test` generates deterministic fixture archives under `build/tests/` and runs engine, parser, persistence, and format tests. For Warcraft III UI changes, run `make test-ui`. Useful tools include `mdxtool`, `maptool`, `m2tool`, `mpqtool`, `blp2jpg`, `blpgen`, and `mdxgen`. Bounded runtime diagnostics use `+com_frame_limit N`.
