# Ability Coverage

This note tracks the current OpenWarcraft3 game-side ability registry against
the reference ability base-code list used for parity work.

Primary local files:

- `games/warcraft3/game/skills/s_skills.c`
- `games/warcraft3/game/skills/*.c`

The practical parity list maps Warcraft ability base codes to concrete ability
type definitions. Unknown or unsupported codes should resolve to explicit local
stubs only when their command cards need to appear.

## Current Model

OpenWarcraft3 currently uses a small Quake-style `ability_t`:

```c
typedef struct ability_s {
    void (*init)(LPCSTR, struct ability_s *);
    void (*cmd)(LPEDICT);
} ability_t;
```

Abilities are discovered through the static `abilitylist[]` in
`games/warcraft3/game/skills/s_skills.c`. Normal unit command buttons are shown only when the
unit ability alias resolves through `Units\AbilityData.slk` to a registered base
code. The command keeps the original alias when dispatching so per-alias SLK
data such as item heal amounts still resolves correctly. Hero abilities are
stored as `heroability_t` entries on the unit, but the skill selection menu is
still incomplete.

Directly copying another engine's ability classes is not mechanical. The local
implementation should port behavior into flat C handlers, `umove_t` state
machines, existing edict fields, and data loaded from SLK/config tables.

## Local Registry

| Code | Local file | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `CmdStop` | `s_stop.c` | Registered, no `cmd`; order helper exists. |
| `CmdMove` | `s_move.c` | Implemented ground move command. |
| `CmdAttack` | `s_attack.c` | Implemented basic melee/ranged attack and projectiles. |
| `CmdBuild` | `s_build.c` | Implemented build menu and placement flow. |
| `CmdHoldPos` | `s_holdpos.c` | Registered stub. |
| `CmdPatrol` | `s_patrol.c` | Registered stub. |
| `CmdCancel` | `s_cancel.c` | Implemented UI cancel. |
| `CmdSelectSkill` | `s_selectskill.c` | Partial; menu draw exists, selection callback is commented out. |
| `Ahar` | `s_harvest_lumber.c` | Partial worker harvest implementation. |
| `Amil` | `s_militia.c` | Registered stub. |
| `Arep` | `s_repair.c` | Partial; repair state helper exists, command is not wired. |
| `Agld` | `s_goldmine.c` | Basic gold mine harvest loop. |
| `AHad` | `s_devotionaura.c` | Partial local-only aura effect; status application is stubbed. |
| `AHhb` | `s_holylight.c` | Partial target spell; validates target/range/masks, spends mana, starts cooldown, heals allies, damages undead enemies, and plays target art. |
| `AHtb` | `s_thunderbolt.c` | Partial target spell; projectile, damage, mana, cooldown, range, target masks, and stun status. |
| `ANfb` | `s_thunderbolt.c` | Partial target spell sharing Thunder Bolt behavior with Fire Bolt data/art. |
| `AHwe`, `AOsf` | `s_summon.c` | Partial no-target summon; reads unit id/count/duration, spawns owned timed-life units. |
| `AHbz`, `AUcs`, `ANcl` | `s_area_spell.c` | Partial point/channel spell family; Blizzard ticks area damage, Carrion Swarm applies a simple point blast, Channel opens cancel mode. |
| `ANch`, `AIco`, `Aeat`, `Ambt`, `Aroo` | `s_utility_abilities.c` | Partial utility behaviors: Charm ownership transfer, Eat Tree heal/remove, Moon Well transfer, Root toggle. |
| `AIhe`, `AIma`, `AImi` | `s_item.c` | Partial item use for heal, mana restore, and permanent life gain; item consumption is not yet wired. |
| Heavy/system abilities | `s_ability_stubs.c` | Registered explicit stubs for passive autocast, cargo, mine, shop, harvest variants, item passives, and stat/XP item families. |

`a_train` exists in `s_train.c`, but training is currently handled by the
generic `Button` command path rather than by a registered ability code.

## Suggested Port Order

1. Finish the common spell plumbing: ability level data, mana/cooldown checks,
   target filters, point/unit/no-target command flows, and buff/status storage.
2. Complete one targeted spell end to end, preferably `AHtb` Thunder Bolt, then
   reuse that path for `ANfb`.
3. Bring `AHhb` to real behavior, replacing the current visual-only local
   implementation with target validation and healing.
4. Add no-target summon spells (`AHwe`, `AOsf`) once timed-life units are
   available.
5. Generalize repair/harvest variants (`Arep`, `Aren`, `Arst`, `Ahrl`, `Awha`,
   `Aaha`) after the base worker loops are stable.
6. Defer cargo, shops, inventory item modifiers, root/entangle mine, and passive
   autocast abilities until the underlying status, item, and transform systems
   exist.
