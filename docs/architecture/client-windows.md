# Client Windows

## Ownership

`client/cl_window.c` owns transient server-authored gameplay windows. Persistent singleton HUD planes remain `svc_layout`
layers. Do not add a `UILAYOUTLAYER` member for an inventory, journal, quest description, or other spawnable window.

The server owns a window's instance ID, opaque game-local class ID, flags, frame tree, and close lifecycle. The client owns
z-order, keyboard focus, pointer capture, and the local drag offset. Updating an existing instance preserves its drag offset.
Opening a `UI_WINDOW_UNIQUE` class replaces and focuses its existing instance.

After opening a pause-owning modal `svc_window`, the client compares pause-owner presence with its last reported pause state.
The first modal without `UI_WINDOW_NO_PAUSE` sends `pause 1`; closing the last pause-owning modal sends `pause 0`. Opening or
closing nested modals sends nothing while a pause owner remains. The game keeps this client request as an independent pause
owner, so it cannot clear a script-owned `PauseGame(true)`. `UI_WINDOW_NO_PAUSE` keeps modal input capture while opting that
window out of this pause handshake; the Warcraft III Allies dialog uses this split.

Windows form a doubly linked list. The head is backmost and the tail is frontmost. Drawing walks head to tail; pointer hit
testing walks tail to head. Left-clicking a window unlinks it and appends it at the tail, making draw order and keyboard focus
change together. Closing the focused window focuses the new tail.

`SCR_DrawLayout()` draws persistent layout layers first and then calls `CL_WindowDraw()`, placing transient windows above the
HUD. Parsing and retaining `svc_window` does not make a window visible by itself; the screen layout pass owns submission.

The legacy `menu.dll` is a menu module, following the Quake II `key_dest` split: `cl_scrn.c` refreshes it only for `key_menu`,
and `cl_input.c` forwards its keyboard/mouse events only for `key_menu`. The active-game pass draws server-authored layout and
windows through `SCR_DrawLayout()`/`CL_WindowDraw()`; it must not call a UI-DLL game overlay or send UI-DLL input.

WoW incoming messages use `FT_MESSAGE_QUEUE` on `LAYER_MESSAGE`. The server emits one compact record per unread message and,
when selected, one additional record carrying the server-owned popup text. `cl_scrn.c` draws both the unread icon pool and the
popup; clicks send `message_open <id>` or `message_close` back to the server, which updates the authoritative layer.

`UI_WINDOW_MODAL`, `UI_WINDOW_NO_PAUSE`, `UI_WINDOW_NO_ESCAPE`, and `UI_WINDOW_UNIQUE` are independent. Modal means the topmost
modal window consumes input outside its bounds. `NO_PAUSE` means that modal does not acquire the client-owned simulation pause.
`NO_ESCAPE` consumes Escape without dismissing the window, for mandatory result/decision flows that must close through an
explicit action. Unique means only one instance of that class may exist. Inventory and quest-detail windows can be unique without
being modal; confirmation-style windows are normally modal pause owners, while the WC3 Allies and game-result windows are modal
plus `NO_PAUSE` for their respective gameplay/script-owned timing semantics.

## Wire Format

```text
svc_window
  byte open
  long instance_id

UI_WINDOW_OPEN:
  long class_id
  long flags
  window frame records
  long 0, short 0
  long text_size
  byte text[text_size]

```

Window frame records retain the normal one-byte type-specific payload size. The `text`, `tooltip`, and `onclick` fields differ:
they are 32-bit offsets into the trailing text arena instead of inline strings. Offset zero means no string; byte zero of every
arena is therefore NUL. The client validates every nonzero offset and requires a terminating NUL within `text_size` before
retaining the packet.

The arena is bounded by `MAX_MSGLEN`, not the 255-byte typed-payload field. This allows quest descriptions, message histories,
and other long text blocks without inflating frame-specific structs. `SCR_ClearWindow` resolves offsets directly into the
retained arena; it does not duplicate strings.

## Input

- Mouse-down on a window raises it and assigns keyboard focus.
- Mouse-down on non-command background starts a drag when `UI_WINDOW_MOVABLE` is set.
- Drag capture continues through motion and mouse-up outside the window.
- Keyboard hotkeys are searched only in the focused window, or the topmost modal window.
- Escape closes the active window unless it has `UI_WINDOW_NO_ESCAPE`; a no-Escape modal consumes the key and stays open.
- Clicking outside all non-modal windows clears focus.
- A modal window blocks world hit testing, control groups, bindings, minimap actions, and manual camera movement.
- Key-up still reaches gameplay `+command` releases so opening or focusing a window cannot leave an input held.
- `close_window_command <command>` forwards the suffix to the server and then closes the owning window; use it for transactional
  Accept/Cancel buttons that must commit or discard server-owned draft state before dismissal.
- Scrollable TextArea state is client-owned. Because a retained `svc_window` packet is reparsed for each draw/hit test,
  `client/cl_window.c` stores scroll fractions by frame number and reapplies them after each parse. Mouse wheel input, scrollbar
  arrows/track, and thumb dragging update that retained value rather than mutating only the temporary parsed frame.
- Transient `FT_EDITBOX`/`FT_GLUEEDITBOX` text is client-owned for the window lifetime. The wire `uiEditBox_t` carries a stable
  control `id` and `maxChars`; `client/cl_window.c` retains text/cursor state by frame number, routes SDL text input through the same
  `menu_text_input.h` helpers used by front-end FDF edit boxes, and reapplies the text after each retained-layout parse.
  Frame numbers are scoped to one serialized layout, not globally unique across the HUD and transient windows. Live edit-text and
  cursor lookup must therefore be restricted to the transient window whose layout is currently prepared. Looking up retained edit
  state by frame number across every open window can replace an unrelated persistent HUD label that happens to reuse that number.
  Gameplay snapshots repeatedly call `CL_SetGameplayInput()`, so that function must preserve SDL text input while
  `CL_WindowTextInputActive()` reports a focused transient edit box. Unconditionally calling `SDL_StopTextInput()` there leaves the
  edit logically focused but prevents SDL from producing `SDL_TEXTINPUT`. Blur/close releases the transient text-input owner, and
  returning from the console to gameplay restores it when the edit is still focused.
- Transient `FT_LISTBOX` selection is also client-owned. The client retains the selected row and scroll fraction. List rows may use
  `display\thidden-value`: drawing hides the suffix, while command placeholder expansion returns it.
- An authored onclick may reference `{ControlId}`. Immediately before forwarding, the window client replaces that token with the
  current edit-box text or selected list value and escapes quotes/backslashes. This is a commit-time control-value handoff, not a
  per-keystroke client-to-server state stream. The WC3 named Save/Load panel is the first consumer.

### Client-owned button actions

Most authored window `onclick` strings are sent back to the game server. Four explicit action tokens are consumed locally by
`client/cl_window.c` instead:

- `UI_WINDOW_CLOSE_ACTION` (`close_window`) closes the owning window;
- `UI_WINDOW_CLOSE_NOTIFY_ACTION` (`close_window_notify`) closes it and therefore participates in modal-list pause synchronization;
- `UI_WINDOW_DISCONNECT_ACTION` (`disconnect_game`) defers a full world-to-front-end transition: disconnect the client, shut down the local server/game module, clear map-scoped renderer state, rebuild menu/FDF state, then show the front-end;
- `UI_WINDOW_QUIT_ACTION` (`quit_application`) queues normal application shutdown.

Disconnect and quit are intended for explicit local activation in server-authored menus. They are never executed merely because a
window packet is received. `disconnect_game` must use the deferred session-boundary action rather than calling `CL_Disconnect()`
directly: gameplay teardown can clear the FDF/template pool, so showing `menu_main` before server/game shutdown leaves the front-end
with missing bindings. Submenu/navigation actions remain ordinary server commands.

## Legacy UI Windows

`svc_ui_window` retains the older WoW `ui.ShowWindow` named-XML toggle. It is migration debt and does not participate in the
generic linked list, focus, dragging, or modal ownership. New gameplay windows must use `svc_window`.

## Validation

```sh
make openwarcraft3
make test
build/bin/openwarcraft3 -data 'data/Warcraft III' -roc +set skip_cutscene 1 \
  +map 'Maps/Campaign/Human02.w3m' +exec /tmp/openwarcraft3-quest-window.cfg +com_frame_limit 175
build/bin/openwarcraft3 -data 'data/Warcraft III' -tft +set skip_cutscene 1 \
  +map 'Maps/Campaign/Human02.w3m' +exec /tmp/openwarcraft3-log-window.cfg +com_frame_limit 175
```

Each temporary config contains 150 `wait` commands followed by `cmd quests` or `cmd log`, then `screenshot 5`. This delay lets
Human02 reach `ca_active` before the command is forwarded to the loopback server. A main-menu launch does not test this protocol:
there is no connected game server to serialize or parse `svc_window`.

The connected Quest run found that authored FDF frames must use `PF_UIWINDOWFRAME` while `ui_window_writing` is true. Sending
them as `PF_UIFRAME` made the inline-string codec dereference the first arena offset (`0x1`). Proxy and authored frames must both
select the offset-aware codec. `wc3_game.hud_authored_window_frame_uses_offset_codec` guards this boundary.

The standalone net tests cover text offsets, a text arena above 255 bytes, screen-pass drawing, unique-class replacement,
linked-list raise order, keyboard focus, and malformed packets without a frame terminator.

### Live edit-box rendering

A transient edit box keeps its in-progress value in client-local window state.
The child `STRING` frame is only the initial server-authored value. String
rendering therefore resolves a live edit value for edit text children before
falling back to `frame->text`; otherwise the cursor can move while newly typed
characters remain invisible.

Transient `LISTBOX` controls may own a direct `SCROLLBAR` child. List scrolling uses row-count/visible-row metrics: wheel and arrow clicks advance one row, track/thumb input maps proportionally across the scrollable row range, and the scrollbar is omitted from drawing when all rows fit.


Transient edit-box text rendering uses the parent edit control's serialized font and text color; the child STRING carries the value and geometry but does not independently own presentation.

- Transient edit-box rendering is parent-owned: the edit control draws the live client-side value directly into its authored STRING/TEXT child rectangle using the serialized edit font/color; the child remains a geometry/value carrier and is not drawn separately.

- Edit-box text is clipped to the parent control's inner backdrop rectangle, not the authored child STRING width; the child still supplies vertical placement. This keeps editable text/cursor width aligned with the visible input background.
