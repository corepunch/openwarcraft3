# Shared Model Shader Contracts

`renderer/r_shader.c` owns the vertex shader shared by WC3 MDX, WoW M2, and SC2 M3 models. Callers use the same contracts regardless of how many sources their game data provides.

## Bone palette

`BZ_BONE_PALETTE_MAX` is 128 matrices, matching the literal `uBones[128]` before commit `2629f076` (#160).
The C preprocessor stringifies this constant into literal `uniform mat4 uBones[128];` for both ordinary and instanced shaders.
CPU palette storage/uploads use the same constant (MDX's `MDX_MATRIX_PALETTE` aliases it). There is no runtime `tr.bone_count`,
GLSL `BZ_BONE_COUNT` define, capacity query, or sizing helper. A C macro expanding to 128 is equivalent to the old literal;
keeping one constant prevents CPU storage and shader array sizes from drifting apart. Vertex palette indices are
`int(i_skin1[i]) + int(uFirstBoneLookupIndex)` and must not be clamped to a hardware-derived estimate.

### Regression and correction

`2629f076` made `tr.bone_count` depend on `R_BonePaletteSize` and added a shader clamp. This changed both shader array length
and CPU upload counts. WC3 `MDLX_BindGeosetMatrixPalette` also stopped constructing palette entries above the reduced count.
At 64 entries, an asset index of 83 became 63: unrelated vertices used the last matrix, corrupting animation and potentially
the apparent size/position of portraits. A model's total skeleton count is not its draw's palette size: MDX geosets map palette
slots through `matrixPalette[]` to node matrices.

Imported [sookyboo's correction](https://github.com/sookyboo/open-realm/commit/069bdced50a477fe53458e1b4b3c398c669db3ba)
initially retained the estimate only as a warning and restored the fixed palette and unchanged indices. The subsequent
hardening removed the misleading estimate and mutable count entirely; shader compile/link results determine backend support.

### Uniform units and the user's report

`GL_MAX_VERTEX_UNIFORM_COMPONENTS` counts scalar components; divide by four to get vec4 vectors. One mat4 consumes four vec4s
(16 components). The removed `BZ_BONE_UNIFORM_RESERVE = 64` meant **64 vec4s reserved for other uniforms**, not 64 available bones.
The former diagnostic estimate was `max(1, min(128, floor((vectors - 64) / 4)))`, with values below the reserve returning 1.
Examples: 256 vectors gives 48 matrices, 320 gives 64, and 576 reaches 128. This budget was a renderer estimate, not a direct
hardware bone-count query. The GLSL compiler/linker checks actual shader resources.

The linked [gist](https://gist.github.com/sookyboo/737f7aec1f7be2b34f5fd1b22c0050f1) is an agent's explanation, **not a driver log**;
its 64-entry example is hypothetical. It cannot establish the user's actual query result or backend capacity.

There is a concrete gl4es query hazard: at upstream revision `81547d986798e876de8b434193920b606a72363f`,
[`gl4es_glGetIntegerv`](https://github.com/ptitSeb/gl4es/blob/81547d986798e876de8b434193920b606a72363f/src/gl/getter.c)
has no translation for desktop `GL_MAX_VERTEX_UNIFORM_COMPONENTS` (`0x8B4A`); it forwards the enum to GLES. GLES2 supports
`GL_MAX_VERTEX_UNIFORM_VECTORS` (`0x8DFB`), not that desktop enum. An invalid query leaves the initialized result at zero,
which the old sizing helper turns into **one matrix**. This is a source-confirmed risk in that gl4es revision, not a confirmed
diagnosis of the user's installed build. Obtain its version, raw query value and immediate `glGetError()` before claiming it.
Do not infer capacity from the physical GPU name. Production no longer issues this unnecessary query.

### Verification and limitations

Temporary targeted logs on an Apple M1 Pro / OpenGL 4.1 context showed 1024 uniform vectors, a linked model program with
128 active `uBones` entries, and ROC menu geoset palettes of 84, 91 and 124 entries. Temporarily substituting a 320-vector
report reproduced a linked 64-entry shader, 64-matrix uploads for those same geosets, and index 83 mapping to 63. This proves
the truncation mechanism locally; it does not reproduce the user's GLES/gl4es driver. Diagnostic edits were removed.

`tests/test_renderer_model.c` captures the actual shader-source submission for ordinary and instanced variants, asserting
literal 128-entry storage and direct indices without renderer initialization or a display. Its GL mocks exercise compile/link
success, vertex/fragment/link rejection, missing/unallocatable driver logs, both shader caches, and the full one-time instanced
identity palette upload. Failed stages must terminate before using or caching a program. Run `make test`.
For live verification, build all three games and launch bounded scenes (WC3 must cover both archive variants):

```bash
make -j4 openwarcraft3 openwow opensc2 install-share
build/bin/openwarcraft3 -data 'data/Warcraft III' +menu_main +screenshot 10 +com_frame_limit 20
build/bin/openwarcraft3 -data 'data/Warcraft III' -tft +menu_main +com_frame_limit 20
build/bin/openwow -data data/world-of-warcraft +menu_character_create +com_frame_limit 20
build/bin/opensc2 -data data/StarCraft2 +map TRaynor01 +com_frame_limit 20
```

Fixed 128 entries cannot overcome a real uniform-storage limit. Supporting such devices needs a separate renderer design
(e.g. palette batches with remapped vertices or another matrix transport). Do not claim the imported patch implements that.
`R_CheckShader` now checks both `GL_COMPILE_STATUS` and `GL_LINK_STATUS`, prints the full driver log (or an explicit
missing-log/allocation diagnostic), and exits with `EXIT_FAILURE`. This is intentional: `ri.error` is wired to `CON_printf`,
and even `Com_Error` currently only prints, so neither guarantees termination. Do not replace this with either logger and
continue drawing. `R_ModelShader` no longer substitutes `SHADER_DEFAULT`, which cannot skin model vertices. Successful links
mark the attached shader objects for deletion; the linked program retains them for its lifetime.

The hardening investigation used a bounded ROC launch with a temporary GL probe: both model shader stages compiled, but
requesting a nonexistent transform-feedback output produced `GL_LINK_STATUS = 0` and a driver error; the ordinary model
program linked successfully. This confirms why compilation status alone was insufficient. The probe was removed.

[Khronos uniform resource rules](https://wikis.khronos.org/opengl/GLSL_Uniforms).

## Lighting

`uLightCount` is always in `[1, 8]`. There is no zero-light fallback and no parallel directional-light uniform family. Game renderers populate one semantic `MODELLIGHTING` value and call `R_SetModelLighting` once; only that renderer proxy packs and uploads `uLightCount` and `uLights[]`.

WoW supplies its world sun, WC3 supplies embedded sources or its default sun, and SC2 supplies the complete three-source key/fill/back rig. Scene ambient is part of `MODELLIGHTING` and the proxy folds it into the first packed entry exactly once.

Each `uLights[i]` mat4 stores one source by GLSL column:

| Column | Values |
|---|---|
| `0` | world position XYZ, type (`0` omni, `1` directional, `2` ambient) |
| `1` | direction XYZ, attenuation start |
| `2` | diffuse RGB, diffuse intensity |
| `3` | ambient RGB, ambient intensity |

`RMODELLIGHT.dir` points from the surface toward the light. The proxy negates it for the stored source-direction convention used by the shader. Game code must not access the shader uniform locations or packed mat4 schema.

The ground/world `sd_default` program can consume the same packed semantic schema through `R_SetDefaultLighting`. Unlike the model
program, its count may be zero: zero deliberately preserves the historical fixed terrain sun/ambient fallback. A nonzero count enables
explicit environment lighting without giving the shared shader any title-specific DNC or time-of-day knowledge. `viewDef_t` carries
evaluated `ENVIRONLIGHT` samples (`terrainLight` / `entityLight`); optional model handles plus `environmentPhase` are sampling
inputs for games that author lights as animated models. `R_SetupEnvironmentLighting` fills the samples. See
[Environment Lighting](environment-lighting.md). Both model and ground paths clamp the final accumulated RGB light factor to
`[0, 1]` before texture modulation; game-specific MDX channel/animation conventions must be normalized before constructing
`MODELLIGHTING`, not encoded in the shared shader schema.

## Instanced grass

The instanced model shader receives the complete effect state in `uGrassParams`, not seven independent uniforms. Its columns are:

| Column | Values |
|---|---|
| `0` | camera XY, fade start, fade end |
| `1` | elapsed seconds, wind speed, wind amplitude, root fraction |
| `2` | phase X/Y, sway direction X/Y |
| `3` | model Z min/max, enabled (`0` or `1`), reserved (`0`) |

`R_SetModelGrass` is the upload boundary and `R_PackModelGrass` is its CPU-side schema helper. Camera Z is deliberately absent because distance fade is evaluated in world XY.

The instance transform is declared as one `in mat4 i_instance`. OpenGL assigns its four columns to consecutive attribute locations beginning at `attrib_instance`; buffer setup still describes those four columns because the vertex API operates per location.

## Per-instance model tint

`renderEntity_t.tint` is optional RGBA modulation for an individual rendered model; alpha zero means the normal white/unmodified value.
WC3's authored MDX cursor uses this to tint only the transient cursor instance without changing the shared model, BLP textures, or
authored geoset animation. The MDX path multiplies the instance tint into the evaluated geoset colour before assigning the existing
`u_geosetColor` state. This deliberately avoids introducing a second shader colour uniform for the same multiplicative concept.
A white tint therefore preserves texture/geoset colour and alpha, while a red `(255,0,0,255)` tint preserves authored alpha and
modulates only RGB. For WC3 MDX instances, a non-zero tint alpha below 255 also makes otherwise opaque/alpha-key layers use ordinary
source-alpha blending for that instance. This is required for transient model opacity such as the construction placement ghost; shader
alpha multiplication alone cannot make a `BLEND_MODE_NONE` layer translucent while GL blending remains disabled. Alpha zero retains its
existing sentinel meaning of unmodified/white rather than invisible.

## Extension rule

Do not add a special count value, a second uniform family, or a per-game shader branch when an existing entry can encode the state. Extend the common schema only when authoritative data requires another value. If the common representation is genuinely incapable of expressing a title's behavior, document the exact constraint before adding an exception.

## Shadow receivers

With `USE_SHADOWMAPS`, the shared model shader exports the first directional light's direct contribution
separately from accumulated lighting. The fragment shader removes only the occluded part before clamping,
so scene ambient and other lights remain. `BZ_SHADOW_GLSL` also serves SC2 terrain/cliffs; see
[SC2 shadow diagnostics](../games/starcraft-2/map-model-unit-data.md#shadow-and-catalog-diagnostics).
The umbrella suite runs the model shader tests with shadows both enabled and disabled.

## Descriptor programs and typed state

All renderer shaders (sprites, ground, MDX/M2/M3, particles, FOW raycast, SC2 terrain/cliffs,
WoW terrain/grass) use `shader_desc_t`. A typed program has `SHADERPROG prog` plus a typed `state`.
`SHADERPROG` owns the linked handle and location table; `UNIFORM` offsets address **state values**,
not locations. `R_LoadShader` resolves inputs once and assigns sampler units in descriptor order.
Draw paths fill values and call `R_ApplyShader(&shader)` immediately before the draw (or once when
setting up an unchanged splat batch). `R_UploadShader(&shader.prog, &state)` also accepts a separate
state value. Only `renderer/r_shader.c` calls `glGetUniformLocation` or `glUniform*`.

This is the renderer's DDX-style table, but `uniformType_t` intentionally remains separate from parser
`bzFieldType_t`. Uniform types encode GLSL declarations, sampler targets, matrix transpose behavior, and
`glUniform*` dispatch; parser field types encode conversion and CPU destination storage. Share the descriptor
pattern and native math structs, not enums whose runtime contracts differ.

- State booleans are C `bool` and GLSL `bool`, including WoW `useWeightedBlend`, `singleTexture`,
  `wmoIndoor`, model alpha-key/unshaded/fog flags. The backend converts to GLint for GL; never read
  a bool through a GLint pointer. WMO blend mode remains an integer, since it is not a boolean.
- Matrices/vectors are native shared math types. Arrays are contiguous inline storage and submit with one
  count-based GL call. The shader keeps its 128-matrix bone capacity, while `boneCount` limits ordinary draws
  to the active MDX geoset, M2 batch, or M3 lookup prefix. Lights keep eight slots and `lightCount` selects
  active entries. Instanced bones initialize to the full identity palette once at program creation.
- `UT_FLOAT_MAT3_TRANSPOSE` describes row-major CPU normal matrices; UV matrices remain column-major.
- Every descriptor uses `UNIFORM`: three arguments describe a scalar, a fourth adds fixed array capacity,
  and a fifth names the state field containing a counted array's active upload count.
- One renderer API submission is **not** one GL call or a UBO. The GL backend walks the descriptor
  and submits active fields, preserving the existing supported dialects without std140 assumptions.
  The long-term shape is Aaltonen's root struct + one push (UBO / persistent-mapped buffer on GL);
  see [renderer-backend.md](../renderer-backend.md) and issues
  [#89](https://github.com/corepunch/open-realm/issues/89) /
  [#93](https://github.com/corepunch/open-realm/issues/93). Do not add a public fixed-function
  `renderState_t` (`lightingEnabled`, `fogMode`) to pick shader permutations.
- Samplers use descriptor declaration order, not linker location order. Shared models/default ground
  use diffuse=0, shadow=1, FOW=2. WoW terrain uses layers=0..3, alpha=4; camera grass explicitly
  assigns its height/control samplers to 5/6 to match existing bindings.
- Inactive locations (`-1`) mean GLSL optimized out a declared input; the upload skips those.
  Shader compile/link failure still terminates, never substitutes another shader.
- Release each `SHADERPROG` with `R_DeleteShader` before its GL context is destroyed.

`make test-renderer-model` exercises generation for 120/140/150/ES3, program cache hit/miss,
compile/link failures, typed offsets, preserved non-sampler values, all upload types, arrays,
boolean true/false, transpose, and inactive inputs. `make test` additionally needs local UDP socket
permissions. On macOS, graphical smoke tests need display access (sandboxed SDL can report no displays).
Use `+screenshot 5 +com_frame_limit 10`; `com_framelimit` is not the registered cvar.
If `+map playercreate` reports missing spawn-map data, use the authoritative explicit WDT path for
renderer verification: `+map World/Maps/Azeroth/Azeroth.wdt` (do not add a runtime map fallback).

SC2 shader shutdown must only delete its programs: `R_Shutdown` currently calls `R_ShutdownModels`
before `R_GameShutdown`. Reusing terrain/map cleanup there attempts to release cliff-model pointers
already removed from the model registry. A bounded TRaynor01 run with targeted shutdown logs confirmed
an abort at the first cliff-model release. Keep map cleanup at its registration boundary; do not
fold it into `R_SC2ShutdownShaders`.

### Packed M2 batch transport

Classic M2 skin sections are expanded into the interleaved `VERTEX` layout because each skin lookup can supply different
bone indices. Once expanded, each output vertex is consumed exactly once and consecutive batches occupy consecutive ranges
of the model-owned VBO. Store those ranges as `DRAWRANGE { first, count }` and submit them with `R_DrawBufferRange` or
`R_DrawBufferRangeInstanced`. Do not add an identity EBO: sequential 32-bit indices provide no reuse and impose avoidable
bandwidth and `glDrawElements*` translation work on GLES compatibility layers. MDX/M3 retain real indexed geometry because
their packed element buffers do reuse vertices.

### Model variant define lifetime

`R_ShaderDefines` returns a shared scratch string and must clear it before composing every model
variant. Commit `63b8da0` omitted that reset: when WoW grass requested the instanced program first,
the later ordinary M2 program retained `BZ_USE_INSTANCING`. Its linked `u_model` location became
`-1`, and regular M2 VAOs were interpreted through unset `a_instance` columns. The visible result
was flickering, screen-sized triangles followed by disappearing characters and creatures.

For this failure, compare the generated vertex source and linked inputs rather than terrain buffers:
the bad normal program contains `#define BZ_USE_INSTANCING 1`, while
`glGetUniformLocation(program, "u_model")` returns `-1`. The pre-change and corrected programs
retain an active model matrix. `renderer_shader.normal_model_defines_do_not_inherit_instancing`
locks the required instanced-then-normal compile order.

### Descriptor upload performance regression and correction

The 26→22 FPS report arrived after `63b8da00`/`f151b435` replaced targeted uniform updates with
`R_ApplyShader`. Code inspection confirmed a CPU/driver regression: every apply walked and uploaded the
complete descriptor state. For the shared model program that included all 128 `uBones` matrices (8 KiB)
plus every view, lighting, material, and sampler uniform on every material draw. Before the descriptor
conversion, MDX uploaded only `min(geoset->num_matrixPalette, 128)` bones, M3 used its active lookup count,
and unchanged WC3 view uniforms were cached. The descriptor path therefore undid the reduced-palette traffic
optimization even though the GLSL lighting equation itself did not become more expensive.

`R_UploadShader` now retains one exact byte cache per linked program and compares each declared value without
including struct padding. A repeated material draw still submits one complete logical state, but issues GL
uniform calls only for fields whose bytes changed. Counted fixed-capacity arrays separate GLSL capacity from
the active upload prefix; `u_bones[128]` remains the shader contract while each format supplies `boneCount`.
The backend also retains the bound program because all shader binding goes through this path. This restores
active-palette traffic and makes camera/view/light values and program binds effectively once-per-change.
Cache hit/miss and counted-array paths have direct unit coverage.

The later RAM work (`51d6d85a`/`e471c472`) packs VBO/EBO storage and converts duplicated vertices to indexed
draws. It does not add per-fragment work and should reduce buffer traffic/residency; lower RAM alone does not
explain an FPS loss unless the old build was already paging. Attribute setup is unchanged for ordinary draws.
The shader upload regression, rather than packed RAM storage, is the code-backed cause addressed here. Compare identical release builds,
resolution, MSAA, camera, and map; the local SC2 screenshot run is not comparable to the reported device/FPS.
