# Ability verification and lifecycle fixes

## Scope and evidence

The September 2026 review at `41602e54` inspected all 39 Warcraft III
`game/skills/*.c` files. Three agents covered combat spells, orders/economy,
and passives/items/campaign handlers; the coordinator covered shared dispatch.
The original baseline passed 1,132 WC3 tests in each archive mode, but sixteen
new behavior scenarios failed and enabling Human autocast crashed. Registry
presence and status-record creation had overstated working functionality.

The fixes retain these reproductions as permanent tests, extend their inverse
and lifecycle coverage, and correct additional failures exposed by that work.
The four new suites contain 37 tests / 302 assertions, passing in both ROC and
TFT modes. Five save-schema tests additionally cover the new channel fields.
This verifies the named contracts, not exhaustive retail parity or rendered art.

## Fixed contracts

| Area | Previous failure | Owning fix and regression evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Human autocast | A boolean message was dereferenced as a target pointer; aliases used base data | Human, validated-spell, Avatar and bolt procedures decode only the current message's union member. The command/HUD/scheduler retain the actual rawcode. Alias cost/heal, runtime membership, switching, removal and unsupported-policy rollback are tested. |
| Repair autocast | Switching related procedures could clear their shared policy flag | Disable the old policy before enabling its replacement; disabling a nonselected alias has no effect. Rejected enable restores the previous policy. |
| Hold Position | Out-of-range acquisition walked toward enemies | Attack returns to stationary scanning; an in-range enemy can still be attacked. |
| Delayed damage | An old projectile kill replaced a newer Move or consumed its queue | Combat completion requires the current Attack procedure and matching target. Animationless post-hit fallback also requires unchanged move and target. |
| Explicit Attack/Smart | Replaced Follow/Patrol/Attack-move resumed after combat | `S_OrderAttack` clears retained movement only after accepting an explicit order. Autonomous acquisition keeps continuation; queued orders replace it only when executed. |
| Repair completion | `building->stand` erased the producer queue | Repair owns the worker's completion only; the target keeps its production behavior and queue. Tests advance the retained trainee. |
| Flame Strike | Damage was treated as a long cast delay; pulses ran every frame | Read Cast/HeroDur/Dur and Hfs1–Hfs6 correctly; preserve absolute fractional pulse deadlines, phases, building multiplier and aggregate cap. |
| Blizzard | Zero Dur truncated six authored waves to two | Wave count and authored interval determine completion, independently of the zero-duration sentinel. |
| Life Drain / Siphon Mana | Life Drain affected mana; channels survived cancellation | Separate authored health/mana fields and allied transfer; validate each cast, tether and entity incarnation at every pulse. |
| Channel lifecycle | No-target casts lacked state; old thinkers survived recasts or stopped new orders | Start all channel shapes consistently; capture a cast serial and owner/target incarnation; route move-leave to the active procedure and explicitly cancel on Stop. Stun, movement, recast, expiry, reuse and save continuation are tested. |
| Aerial Shackles | The caster buff was applied to the victim, so movement/attacks remained allowed | Read the target member of the authored buff pair. Remove its lock when that channel ends, preserving a replacement cast's lock. |
| Storm Bolt | Spell immunity blocked damage but not stun; creep level selected Hero duration | Check impact acceptance before applying stun and use actual Hero identity for HeroDur. |
| Frost Nova | A no-target burst damaged around the caster | Register a unit target; apply direct DataB damage and area DataA damage around that target. |
| Resurrection | Only Heroes were eligible | The no-target spell finds ordinary friendly corpses in the authored area/count, reuses their edicts, retires death state and restores unit/food activity. Reject an empty cast before committing resources. |
| Attribute items | Strength, Agility and Intelligence were rotated | Both permanent tomes and passive attribute aliases use DataA=Agility, DataB=Intelligence, DataC=Strength. |
| Passive items | Exact base-code comparisons discarded stock alias bonuses | `A_ITEM_ADD` / `A_ITEM_REMOVE` carry `abilityitem_t` to the owning passive procedure. Read each alias's amount on pickup/drop; no per-family global amount cache. Stacked items survive save/load and independent removal. |
| Natural creep sleep | Wake removed unrelated owned overlays | Tag sleep art with ACsp and require that identity during cleanup. Wake, move and disable preserve regeneration art. |

## Data and timing

Use the archive audit instead of inferring fields from tooltip prose:

```sh
build/bin/ability_audit -data 'data/Warcraft III' -roc -raw AIsm
build/bin/ability_audit -data 'data/Warcraft III' -tft -raw AHfs
python3 tools/wc3_ability_class_audit.py --format=coverage
```

The active TFT Flame Strike row uses Hfs1/DataA for full pulse damage,
Hfs2/DataB for its interval, Hfs3/DataC for lesser pulse damage, Hfs4/DataD
for its interval, Hfs5/DataE for the building multiplier, and Hfs6/DataF
for the aggregate damage cap. Cast is the initial delay; HeroDur supplies
the full-damage phase and Dur the damage lifetime. Deadlines advance from
the previous scheduled pulse, so a 0.33-second interval does not become
0.4 seconds on every 100 ms server tick. Positive sub-frame intervals are
caught up at the next simulation step; invalid intervals are rejected/logged.

Both ROC and TFT archive audits confirm AItg → AIat (attack bonus 1),
AId1 → AIde (armor 1), and the three tome attribute columns. Combat fixtures
include an explicit ROC numbered Data11/Data12 conversion test for Blizzard.
Running TFT numeric fixtures in ROC mode verifies runtime compatibility;
it does not independently verify every ROC authored value or TFT-only spell.

## Dispatch and persistence

`abilityCall_t` is a message-tagged union. `A_COMMAND` supplies a client,
`A_INIT` a classname, `A_AUTOCAST_SET` a boolean, and only target-bearing
messages supply a `spellTarget_t`. Never eagerly read the target union member
before deciding which message is being handled.

`edict.channel.code` is nonzero on the caster only. Each channel thinker
retains its spell rawcode in `class_id`, the cast `channel.serial`, and
`owner_spawn_time` / `target_spawn_time` where applicable. Reused owner/target
slots and replacement casts cannot inherit an old effect. `S_SpellEndChannel`
clears only a matching cast, then releases its thinker; cancellation does not
install Stand over an already accepted replacement order.

Save format **21** adds this channel identity state to the edict schema.
Older save versions are rejected. The new channel callbacks are appended to
`save_cfunctions[]`; never reorder existing callback indexes. The saved
channel origin is preserved for movement cancellation after loading. A live
drain and stacked passive item aliases have production WriteGame/ReadGame
continuation tests, in addition to the individual schema tests.

## Tests

```sh
make test-wc3-engine WC3_PATTERN='wc3_ability_*'
make test-wc3-engine WC3_PATTERN='wc3_order_lifecycle.*'
make test-wc3-engine WC3_PATTERN='wc3_item_lifecycle.*'
make test-wc3-engine WC3_PATTERN='wc3_save.*'
make test
make build
```

Permanent regression sources are `game/tests/t_ability_dispatch.c`,
`t_ability_lifecycle.c`, `t_order_lifecycle.c`, and `t_item_lifecycle.c`.
Existing combat, building, spell and save tests also check affected paths.
Final verification on 2026-09-13: `make test` passes 3,228 test invocations /
65,585 assertions across 20 suite invocations, including 1,174 WC3 tests /
25,316 assertions per archive mode. `make build` passes. Both builds emit no
compiler warnings; registry coverage remains 193 registered TFT class IDs.
Use full local socket access for the aggregate suite's UDP tests; sandbox
bind denial is not a gameplay failure. No interactive game launch was needed.

## Limits and history

The fixes address reproduced defects and their related lifecycle cases.
Previously documented partial implementations remain partial: Wisp/Acolyte
harvesting, mine transformations, general transport drop, Purchase Item,
Mirror Image's complete illusion semantics, several status-only spells,
and Siphon Mana's temporary above-maximum mana/decay behavior. Visual effects,
full target-mask vocabulary and comprehensive retail spell parity remain
separate work. Do not interpret a registered procedure as complete behavior.

Blame traced the unsafe Human union reads to `e12b63ad0`, Flame/Drain field
and timer errors to `22ff3692`, item alias/attribute errors to `85fd0906`,
attack continuation to `317fc09ae`, Repair completion to `6d5025e92`, and sleep
overlay cleanup to `ebbe30e2`. These histories explain why the new regressions
exercise caller/event order, authored aliases and inverse behavior rather
than only testing procedure lookup.
