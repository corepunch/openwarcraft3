# Warcraft III Attack Damage

## Contract

OpenRealm keeps normal WC3 attack damage in three layers:

1. `unitAttack_t.damageBase` + dice describe the permanent displayed range.
2. `unitAttack_t.temporaryDamageBonus` is added after the dice roll and is shown as a green/red `+N/-N` suffix.
3. `G_AttackDamage()` applies the target-facing attack-type/defense-type multiplier and numeric armor.

The ordinary Attack 1 path is:

```text
unit object data
  -> permanent runtime attack mutations (`ratx`, `ratd`, Hero primary attribute)
  -> roll `damageBase + NdS + temporaryDamageBonus`
  -> attack-type x defense-type multiplier
  -> numeric armor
  -> `T_Damage`
```

Melee resolves the target-facing stages at the damage point. Missile attacks roll at launch but defer `G_AttackDamage()` until projectile impact, so armor/defense changes while the missile is in flight affect the hit. Spell missiles provide their own `currentmove/endfunc` and do not enter this physical-attack mitigation branch.

## Runtime Attack Fields

`edict_t.attack1` and `attack2` are mutable copies of `UnitWeapons.slk` data. Both are initialized at spawn even though combat order selection still uses Attack 1.

For each `unitAttack_t`:

- `damageBase`: permanent base used by the HUD range and roll.
- `numberOfDice`, `sidesPerDie`: `NdS` random component.
- `permanentDamageBonus`: permanent modifier ledger used to survive Hero stat recomputation (for example `ratx`).
- `temporaryDamageBonus`: item/temporary modifier added to each roll but not folded into the base range.
- `cooldown`, `damagePoint`, `range`: attack timing/range.
- splash/bounce metadata is parsed but the special weapon behaviors are not yet implemented.

The displayed permanent range is:

```text
min = max(0, damageBase + numberOfDice)
max = max(0, damageBase + numberOfDice * sidesPerDie)
```

A temporary bonus is rendered separately, for example `12 - 18 +3`.

## Damage Roll

`skills/s_attack.c:ai_rolldamage1()` performs one RNG draw per die:

```text
raw = damageBase
    + sum(random(1..sidesPerDie))
    + temporaryDamageBonus
```

Malformed zero-sided dice contribute `+1` rather than taking modulo zero, matching the current Warsmash edge behavior.

OpenRealm still uses the process C `rand()` stream. It does not yet have Warsmash's dedicated seeded simulation RNG contract for attack rolls.

## Gameplay Constants

`InitConstants()` loads combat values from the active Misc data cache. `war3mapMisc.txt` is loaded after stock Misc files and can override them.

Relevant fields:

- `DamageBonusNormal`
- `DamageBonusPierce`
- `DamageBonusSiege`
- `DamageBonusChaos`
- `DamageBonusMagic`
- `DamageBonusHero`
- `DamageBonusSpells` (if absent, copy the active Magic row as Warsmash does)
- `DefenseArmor`
- `StrAttackBonus`
- `AgiDefenseBonus`
- `AgiAttackSpeedBonus`

The defense-column order is:

```text
small, medium, large, fort, normal, hero, divine, none
```

Stock fallback values are retained only for missing data/bootstrap tests. In particular, ordinary attack classes deal `0.05x` to Divine while Chaos deals `1.00x`.

## Numeric Armor

Let `A` be `G_UnitArmorValue(target)` and `K` be `Misc.DefenseArmor` (stock fallback `0.06`).

For `A >= 0`:

```text
multiplier = 1 / (1 + K*A)
```

For `A < 0`:

```text
multiplier = 2 - (1 - K)^(-A)
```

`G_AttackDamage()` applies:

```text
final = raw * DamageBonus[attackType][defenseType] * armorMultiplier
```

and preserves OpenRealm's existing minimum-one physical-hit rule.

`armor_value` is the derived/base armor plus tracked persistent modifiers. `permanent_armor_bonus` (research) and `temporary_armor_bonus` (items) are kept separately so `G_RecomputeHeroStats()` cannot erase them when Agility changes. `G_UnitArmorValue()` then layers timed status armor such as `Bdef` on top.

## Hero Attack Math

For heroes, `G_RecomputeHeroStats()` applies the active `Misc.StrAttackBonus` to the current primary attribute (`STR`, `AGI`, or `INT`) and adds `permanentDamageBonus` when rebuilding each runtime attack.

Current limitation: OpenRealm's `doodadHero_t` stores only total STR/AGI/INT, not Warsmash's separate base and bonus attributes. Therefore primary-attribute item/stat bonuses are still folded into the permanent damage range rather than displayed as a separate green primary-attribute damage bonus. `AIat` attack bonuses are separated correctly.

Agility attack timing uses:

```text
totalBonus = agility * Misc.AgiAttackSpeedBonus
clampedBonus = clamp(totalBonus, -0.90, +4.00)
divisor = 1 + clampedBonus
```

Both damage point and cooldown recovery are divided by that divisor. OpenRealm does not yet have the other Warsmash attack-speed modifier sources, so only the Agility contribution is currently present.

## Upgrade Effects

The generic research dispatcher implements:

- `ratx`: permanent flat attack damage using `base + mod*(level-1)` and applying only the old/new delta.
- `ratd`: attack dice using the same level-value/delta rule.
- `rarm`: armor using the unit type's `armorPerUpgrade`, tracked in `permanent_armor_bonus`.

These affect existing owned units and newly spawned units that inherit already-researched player tech.

## Item Attack/Armor Modifiers

`AIat` changes `temporaryDamageBonus` rather than `damageBase`. This prevents later Hero stat recomputation from erasing the item bonus and makes the HUD show the modifier separately.

`AIde` changes both `temporary_armor_bonus` and the current `armor_value`, so later Hero Agility recomputation preserves the item armor modifier.

## Destructable Attack Targeting

Destructables use their `targType`/Targeted As category together with the
attacking unit's `targs1` target list. Warcraft stores `UnitWeapons.slk`
`targs1`/`targs2` as comma-separated names such as
`ground,structure,debris,item,ward`; OpenRealm decodes those names to the
`targetflag` mask (`tree=64`, `wall=128`, `debris=256`, `decoration=512`,
`bridge=1024`) before copying Attack 1 into runtime state. Map object-data
`ua1g`/`ua2g` overrides remain numeric masks.

Smart/right-click turns ordinary `debris` into an implicit attack, which keeps
breakable crates convenient. Trees keep worker harvesting precedence and do
not Smart-attack, but the explicit Attack command may attack a live tree even
when the standard weapon target list omits `tree` (as retail UnitWeapons data
commonly does). Wall/bridge/decoration classes still require explicit Attack
and the corresponding weapon target bit. This prevents right-click from
attacking every selectable destructable merely because it has life.

Relevant coverage is in `games/warcraft-3/game/tests/t_destructable.c`.

## Known Gaps

The current implementation intentionally does not invent the larger Warsmash combat-listener architecture. Remaining work includes:

- attacker pre-damage listeners (critical strike, bash, Wind Walk, attack replacement/orbs);
- low-ground miss and target evasion;
- target damage-taken and final-damage listeners;
- generic distinction between attack type and damage type / numeric-armor bypass;
- `MSPLASH`, `ARTILLERY`, `MBOUNCE`, `MLINE`/`ALINE` damage behavior;
- combat selection between Attack 1 and Attack 2;
- full unit weapon target-mask enforcement (`UnitWeapons.targs1` / `targs2`)
  for ordinary unit-vs-unit combat. Destructable target classes are now checked
  against Attack 1's runtime `targetsAllowed` mask before Smart or explicit
  Attack can start, but air/ground/structure/etc. unit selection and Attack 2
  combat selection still need the broader target-mask implementation;
- separate Hero base-vs-bonus attributes for Warsmash-exact green primary-stat damage;
- seeded combat RNG independent from unrelated `rand()` consumers;
- non-Agility attack-speed buffs/debuffs.

Attack-target validation takes both the attacker and target, including the animationless building recovery checks used by Orc Burrows. Those recovery checks apply the same weapon target mask as initial attack orders and attack windup validation.

## Verification

Relevant source/tests:

- `games/warcraft-3/game/skills/s_attack.c`
- `games/warcraft-3/game/g_phys.c`
- `games/warcraft-3/game/m_unit.c`
- `games/warcraft-3/game/g_building.c`
- `games/warcraft-3/game/skills/s_item_stats.c`
- `games/warcraft-3/game/tests/t_combat.c`
- `games/warcraft-3/game/tests/t_building.c`

The combat tests cover representative type multipliers, Divine, data-driven constants, positive/negative armor, Hero modifier preservation, and the attack-speed cap. Research tests cover `ratx` level-delta semantics.
