# Warcraft III Autocast and Auto Repair

## Scope

OpenRealm has a small generic autocast contract in `ability_t` and currently uses it for the Repair family (`Arep`, `Aren`, `Arst`). The scheduler owns *when* an idle unit gets an automatic acquisition opportunity; the ability owns toggle state, target selection, and issuance of its ordinary order.

The implementation intentionally does not turn the existing `AB_AUTOCAST` metadata flag into behavior for every spell. Cold Arrows and other autocast abilities still need their own targeting/execution rules.

## Ability contract

`ability_t` appends three optional hooks after the existing dispatch fields:

- `autocast_is_on(unit)` reads ability-specific toggle state;
- `autocast_set(unit, enabled)` changes it;
- `autocast_acquire(unit)` looks for a target and, on success, issues the normal ability order.

`G_SetUnitAutocast()` enforces the current Warsmash-compatible one-selected-autocast rule: enabling one autocast-capable ability disables the other autocast hooks present on that unit. `AI_AUTOCAST_ACTIVE` is only a fast unit-wide marker; ability-specific state remains authoritative.

The Repair family stores its state in `AI_AUTOCAST_REPAIR`, so the toggle survives ordinary Repair completion and order interruption with the rest of the edict state.

## Command-card toggle

A command button can expose an optional secondary command through `gameCommandButton_t.alternate`. The WC3 HUD serializes it in the command frame's `text` field; `alternate_active` maps to `UIFLAG_ALTERNATE_ACTIVE` for the active glow.

For Repair the secondary command is:

```text
autocast <repair rawcode>
```

Left click remains the normal Repair targeting action. Right-button down/up over a command button with a secondary command is consumed by the client layout layer so it cannot also become a world Smart order. Right-button up sends the secondary command.

The server toggles all controllable selected units that carry the same Repair handler and plays `AutoCastButtonClick`. Enabling Auto Repair on an already idle worker immediately tries one acquisition pass; toggling during active movement/work does not interrupt that behavior.

JASS/string immediate orders `repairon` and `repairoff` use the same toggle path. Numeric `IssueImmediateOrderById` now exists for canonical table entries, but repair toggle order IDs are not part of that table and continue to use their string path.

## Acquisition ordering

`ai_stand()` retains the existing staggered acquisition cadence. At an acquisition slot it now performs:

```text
try enabled autocast abilities
    -> if one starts an order, stop
otherwise
try normal automatic attack acquisition
```

This lets a worker with an attack prefer a valid Auto Repair target over an enemy when both are available. Units with no attack can still autocast because the autocast pass occurs before the attack-capability early return.

The current implementation only integrates this with ordinary idle/default stand. Hold Position, Attack-Move, Patrol, Follow, and other behaviors need explicit resume/movement semantics before they should call generic autocast.

## Auto Repair target policy

Repair implements Warsmash's `NEARESTVALID` policy for units:

1. Read the worker's normal acquisition range with `G_AcquisitionRange()`.
2. Enumerate nearby edicts in a box expanded by the worker collision radius.
3. Reject candidates that the existing Repair rules do not accept.
4. Rank valid candidates by collision-aware edge distance:

```text
max(0, center_distance - worker_collision - target_collision)
```

5. Issue the ordinary `repair` entity-target order for the nearest candidate.

The acquisition range is a discovery radius, not Repair cast range. Once the normal Repair order is issued, `s_repair.c` remains authoritative for footprint-aware approach routing, `Rng`, work animation, completed-building costs, Human paused-construction/power-building rules, failure, completion, and Shift-order continuation.

Current Auto Repair target coverage deliberately matches the high-confidence Repair validator already implemented in OpenRealm: owned buildings, plus paused Human construction where `Arep` permits it. Allied/mechanical/destructible target-mask expansion and `DataE` naval range remain separate gaps.

## Repair cancellation and replacement orders

Repair cleanup must not destroy state already installed by the replacement order. Move/Attack/Follow paths can install their new goal before `unit_setmove()` switches away from the Repair move, and that switch calls `S_CancelRepair()`.

`S_CancelRepair()` therefore clears `goalentity` only when it still names the Repair-owned target. If a replacement order has already installed a different goal, that goal is preserved. Conversely, an ordinary Stop/stand transition still retires the old Repair target.

This ownership rule prevents the previous crash where Move installed a waypoint, Repair cancellation nulled it, and the new movement behavior subsequently dereferenced the missing goal.

## Diagnostics

Autocast investigative diagnostics are compile-time disabled in normal builds. Build the WC3 game module with `WC3_DEBUG_AUTOCAST` defined, then opt into runtime verbosity with:

```text
+set wc3_autocast_debug 1
```

Level 1 reports toggle/acquisition/Repair lifecycle summaries. Level 2 also reports every Auto Repair candidate and its rejection reason. Without `WC3_DEBUG_AUTOCAST`, neither the diagnostic CVar lookup nor the per-order/per-candidate tracing is compiled into the game module.

Useful prefixes:

```text
WC3_AUTOCAST
WC3_AUTOREPAIR
```

Typical level-2 candidate output distinguishes reasons such as full health, wrong owner, construction state, missing Repair code, and ordinary Repair target-rule rejection. Keep this logging behind both the `WC3_DEBUG_AUTOCAST` compile-time guard and the runtime CVar; do not add unconditional per-frame acquisition logs.

## Tests

Focused coverage lives primarily in `games/warcraft-3/game/tests/t_building.c` and `tests/test_net.c` and covers:

- Repair toggle state and `repairon` / `repairoff`;
- command-card secondary command serialization and active state;
- client right-click dispatch/consumption;
- nearest valid damaged building selection;
- collision-aware acquisition of a large nearby building whose centre lies outside `uacq`;
- ignoring a nearer full-health building;
- autocast before idle auto-attack, with attack fallback when autocast is off;
- routing automatic/manual Repair through the normal target-order path;
- Shift-queued Repair;
- moving away while repairing without losing the replacement goal;
- normal Repair cleanup still clearing a Repair-owned goal.
