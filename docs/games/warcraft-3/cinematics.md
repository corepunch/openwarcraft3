# WC3 Cinematic / Cutscene System

## Developer cinematic cheats

In-map Warcraft III cutscenes are ordinary map JASS triggers. With `sv_cheats 1`,
OpenRealm exposes a thin debugging layer over the same trigger/event machinery:

```text
cinematic list [filter]
cinematic play <trigger-index> [selected]
cinematic stop
```

`cinematic list` is discovery only. It reports registered triggers whose **action**
function names contain strong cinematic markers (`cinematic`, `cutscene`, `intro`,
`outro`, `ending`, or `interlude`). It rejects obvious `skip`, `time_stop`/`timestop`,
and `cheat` helpers. Generic `victory` and `defeat` names are intentionally not
cinematic evidence because maps commonly use them for ordinary mission progression.
The map does not carry a canonical cinematic-trigger table, so this heuristic may
still miss unusually named cutscenes; use `trigger list [filter]` to inspect every
registered trigger when that happens.

`cinematic play` deliberately shares `trigger fire` semantics: run the chosen
trigger's authored actions directly, even if the trigger is disabled and without
evaluating conditions. This preserves the real camera natives, transmissions,
unit orders, waits, cinefilters, quest/result changes, and any later map logic.
`selected` supplies the current selected unit as event subject when the authored
actions require `GetTriggerUnit()` / unit-derived `GetTriggerPlayer()` context.
Other event-specific response fields are not synthesized.

`cinematic stop` follows the existing Escape lifecycle instead of directly
changing `client_ui_state`, camera state, or user control. It publishes
`EVENT_PLAYER_END_CINEMATIC` for human players so the map's registered
`TriggerRegisterPlayerEventEndCinematic` actions perform their own skip flag and
cleanup. This is important because forcibly hiding the cinematic panel would not
stop the running JASS coroutine or undo map-authored unit/camera state.

These commands cover scripted cutscenes inside the loaded map. The JASS
`PlayCinematic(movieName)` path for prerendered movie files is separate and still
depends on movie playback support.

## Architecture

Cutscenes in Warcraft III are driven entirely by the map's JASS script (`war3map.j`). The engine provides JASS native bindings; the script orchestrates timing, camera, dialogue, and unit movement.

Pre-rendered campaign movies are a separate client media path driven by `PlayCinematic`; see [Pre-rendered Movies](pre-rendered-movies.md). They do not use the in-engine cinematic HUD/camera pipeline described below.

### Flow

1. **Enter cinematic mode:** JASS calls `CinematicModeBJ(true, player)` → `ShowInterface(false)` → sets `client_ui_state = CLIENT_UI_CINEMATIC`.
2. **Dialogue:** `TransmissionFromUnitWithNameBJ(...)` → `SetCinematicSceneBJ(...)` → `SetCinematicScene(...)` → sets speaker/dialogue text on `currentplayer`.
3. **Unit movement:** `IssuePointOrderLocBJ(unit, "move", location)` → `unit_issueorder` → `order_move` → `unit_setmove(self, &move_move_walk)`.
4. **Per-frame update:** `monster_think` → `M_MoveFrame` advances `self->s.frame` each game tick. `ai_move_walk` moves the unit.

### ESC / Skip Mechanism

- ESC is bound to `cmd cancel` (`games/warcraft-3/share/config.cfg` line 9).
- `CMD_Cancel` (`g_commands.c:199`) publishes `EVENT_PLAYER_END_CINEMATIC` for the canceling player and all other human players.
- The map registers a trigger via `TriggerRegisterPlayerEventEndCinematic(trigger, player)`. When the event fires, the trigger sets a skip flag (e.g. `udg_IntroSkipped = true`) and calls cleanup: `CinematicModeBJ(false, ...)`, `SetUserControlForceOn(...)`, `ResetToGameCameraForPlayer(...)`.
- The main cinematic coroutine checks the skip flag after each `TriggerSleepAction` and returns early.

### Skip Cutscene Cvar

The `skip_cutscene` cvar provides an engine-level fast-forward. When set to `1`:
- `SetCinematicScene` returns early (no dialogue)
- `TriggerSleepAction` sleeps only 1ms
- Camera durations forced to 0
- Cinefilter forced off

`ShowInterface` and `EnableUserControl` still honor the JASS booleans while the script fast-forwards. Keeping cinematic
UI/input state prevents edge-scroll camera messages from racing the script: the final camera setup must land before cleanup
restores input.

This is separate from the JASS-level ESC skip mechanism.

## Debugging

For the complete retail-map instrumentation, legacy repacking workflow, Wine
launch command, failure modes, and low-noise sampling options, see [Retail
Warcraft III camera tracing](retail-camera-tracing.md).

### Console Commands
- `skip_cutscene 1` — fast-forward all cinematic timing
- `skip_cutscene 0` — restore normal timing

Camera and transmission natives should not grow permanent investigative tracing; use the focused JASS/network tests below or a bounded campaign run to inspect their state. The pre-existing `CLIENTCOMMAND(Cancel)` path still prints its ESC/end-cinematic event publication, but this cinematic parity work adds no runtime debug logging.

### Common Issues

**Opening cinematic runs too fast after a mission/map load:**
The authored JASS waits and camera durations can be correct while the whole opening still fast-forwards if the generic server scheduler carries wall-clock loading time forward as simulation debt. `SV_Frame` advances at most one 100 ms game step per outer-loop call; without a backlog clamp, a multi-second synchronous map/resource load can leave `sv.next_frame_msec` seconds behind `svs.realtime`. At a high render rate the following outer-loop iterations then each advance 100 ms of JASS/camera time only ~15–16 ms apart until the debt drains. This was confirmed on Prologue01 on both an initial load and a same-process restart; `skip_cutscene` remained disabled and `TriggerSleepAction` retained the authored durations.

The fix belongs in the generic server scheduler, not the WC3 cinematic natives: `SV_ClampSimulationDeadline` rebases deadlines that are more than one fixed tick overdue before `SV_RunGameFrame`, discarding loading latency while preserving ordinary sub-tick lateness. See [Server Architecture](../../architecture/server.md) and `server_net.scheduler_clamps_multi_tick_wall_clock_backlog`.

A same-process restart also resets map/server time while the client renderer survives. `V_AdvanceSceneTime` therefore treats a backwards scene timestamp as a new render epoch and forces `deltaTime = 0` for that frame; otherwise unsigned `DWORD` subtraction can produce a near-`2^32` ms effect delta. This is a separate one-frame restart hazard, covered by `net.scene_time_rewind_starts_a_new_render_epoch` and documented in [Client Architecture](../../architecture/client.md).

**Mismatched player numbers in SetCinematicScene/EndCinematicScene:**
`currentplayer` is the `GetLocalPlayer()` presentation selector, not the owner
of the unit that fired an event. Event ownership belongs in
`JASSCONTEXT.playerState` for `GetTriggerPlayer()`; local-player execution lives
in `JASSCONTEXT.localPlayerState`. `TriggerExecute()` must inherit those values
independently.

Human02 provides a concrete regression case: the victory chain begins when the
Blademaster (map player 4) dies, then executes nested victory/cinematic triggers
whose local UI guards target the connected Human player (map player 1). If the
dying unit owner is copied into `currentplayer`, the trigger and waits still run
but the player-1 camera/UI/dialogue branches are skipped, producing an invisible
victory cinematic before `RemovePlayer(Player(1), VICTORY)`. The
`wc3_api.enemy_event_keeps_trigger_player_separate_from_local_player_context`
test covers this event-owner/local-player split through a nested
`TriggerExecute()` chain.

**ESC moves units but leaves both the cinematic camera and cinematic HUD active:**
After the entity/player contract trim (#162), an incremental build could leave `libjass` compiled against the old
`edict_t`/`GAMECLIENT` layout. `jass.h` includes `game/g_local.h`; `jass_eventplayer()` dereferences `unit->client->ps`,
but the original JASS make rule tracked only JASS sources and `libshared`, not game/common headers.
The trigger's global actions still ran, while `GetLocalPlayer()` guards failed for camera/UI cleanup.

Confirmed on ROC `Maps\Campaign\Human02.w3m`: connection edict 0 represents map player 1. Before rebuilding the VM,
ESC at 4200 ms left server and decoded client `client_ui_state=2`, cinematic quaternion and FOV 45; camera prediction
was inactive. Rebuilding JASS without changing its behavior restored the same skip path: `ResetToGameCamera` and
`ShowInterface(true)` ran for player 1, both sides returned to state 0, FOV 50, distance 1650, gameplay quaternion
approximately `(-0.292,0,0,0.956)`. This was a stale module ABI, not a missing snapshot field.

`JASS_HEADERS` in `games/warcraft-3/game.mk` now tracks the shared/game header dependency closure. Do not widen the
network structs or force the client UI to game mode to mask this failure.

Regression checks:

```sh
make test-jass-build
make test-wc3-engine WC3_PATTERN='wc3_api.escape*'
make test
```

The VM test sends the real cancel command through the event queue, uses a nonmatching connection/map slot, checks an
unrelated player's cancel does nothing, and asserts gameplay UI flags, control, target, FOV, distance and quaternion.
`net.cinematic_cleanup_restores_camera_and_ui_samples` separately checks serialization through `CL_ParseServerMessage`.
The build test uses `make -n -W <header>`; removing `JASS_HEADERS` makes it fail on `common/shared.h`.

For bounded campaign verification, create a config containing 150 `wait` lines, `cmd cancel`, 80 more `wait` lines,
then `screenshot`. Launch once without `-tft` and once with it:

```sh
build/bin/openwarcraft3 -data 'data/Warcraft III' +map 'Maps\Campaign\Human02.w3m' +exec /tmp/escape.cfg +com_frame_limit 280
```

Use the ESC binding's command (`cmd cancel`), not `skip_cutscene`, which exercises a different lifecycle.
See [build/platform contracts](../../build-and-renderer-platforms.md) for incremental-build and pixel-format constraints.

**TransmissionFromUnitWithNameBJ not showing dialogue:**
`ForceEnumPlayers` must populate the force for `IsPlayerInForce(GetLocalPlayer(), ...)` guards in `Blizzard.j`. If empty, all transmissions are skipped silently.

**Transmissions flash too fast:**
`TriggerWaitForSound` must sleep the full millisecond duration, not a fraction.

**Cinematic HUD layers hidden:**
`CLIENT_UI_CINEMATIC` hides portrait, console, command bar, info panel, inventory via `UI_LayoutShouldSkipLayoutLayer` in `client/cl_unit_layout.c`.

**Cinematic chrome/text visible but talking-head portraits missing:**
Warcraft unit portraits use a companion model (`Foo_Portrait.mdx`) stored in `cl.portraits[]` beside the world model in `cl.models[]`. Initial `CS_MODELS` configstrings must remain registration data until `CL_PrepRefresh()`, because that pass loads both files. Do not eagerly populate `cl.models[]` from `CL_ParseConfigString()` before `cl.refresh_prepped`: `CL_PrepRefresh()` skips non-null model slots, which otherwise prevents every companion portrait from loading. Once refresh is prepared, a dynamic model configstring must release and reload both the world-model and portrait-model slots together. `SetCinematicScene` transports the normal model configstring index; `FT_PORTRAIT` prefers `cl.portraits[index]` on the client.

**Fast-forward ends at the last cinematic camera position:**
Log server `playerState.vieworigin`, client camera prediction, `client_ui_state`, and `no_control` together. If gameplay input
becomes active before the final camera native, edge scrolling can send `clc_camera_position` during the accelerated script
and overwrite the authoritative snap. `skip_cutscene` must shorten timing only; the JASS cleanup owns the UI and input
transition.

### DisplayText Message Overlay

`DisplayTextToPlayer` and its timed variants pass message content and `(x,y)` screen position to `UI_ShowText`. The server constructs the message overlay as a static C `FRAMEDEF` pair (`FT_FRAME` root with `FT_TEXTAREA` child) in `hud_write.c`. The C code owns the full-screen parent, text-area size, font, inset, and default anchor as inline float values. A valid JASS position overrides only the copied text frame's anchor for that serialized message. Missing or out-of-range coordinates retain the default anchor.

## Branch Maintenance

WC3 gameplay features live on `main` as `wc3:` commits. Feature branches that diverge from `main` will miss these fixes. Before testing WC3 campaign maps, always check that the branch is up to date with `main`:
```
git log --oneline main..HEAD | wc -l   # commits behind main
git log --oneline HEAD..main | wc -l   # commits ahead of main
```

Key `wc3:` commits to watch:
- `6cd01ebd` — cinematic dialogs/portraits (ForceEnumPlayers fix)
- `55724517` — collision & pathfinding parity
- `76b701a4` — JASS natives (camera, events)
- `4a56a651` — gradual unit turning
- `dcac4868` — authentic collisionSize

## Implementation Notes

### Unit Movement During Cutscenes

Units move using the same system as normal gameplay: JASS scripts issue move orders via `IssuePointOrder`/`IssuePointOrderLoc`. The pathfinding and collision system handles the rest. For cutscenes with many simultaneous movers (e.g. 8 footmen), the destination-keyed heatmap cache (16 slots) and unreachable-cell skipping prevent performance issues.

### Camera Control

Camera follows units via `SetCameraTargetController`. The camera interpolation runs in `G_RunClients()` each frame, lerping position/FOV and other scalar fields between `camera.start_time` and `camera.end_time`. Euler angle components use `CL_GameLerpDegrees()` with WC3 shortest-periodic-arc interpolation rather than raw numeric lerp. This is required because Warcraft-authored angle-of-attack values can represent the same orientation with numbers separated by whole revolutions: for example `CameraSetupSetField(..., 304)` stores pitch `-394`, while `ResetToGameCamera` uses `326`; those differ by `720` degrees but are equivalent modulo `360`. Raw lerp makes the camera rotate under the terrain and back over it during cinematic cleanup. The snapshot carries Euler `viewangles`; the client converts those to quaternions and slerps between 10 Hz samples. The `G_UpdateCameraTarget` function follows `target_controller` unit's position plus offset. When `inheritOrientation` is true, the authoritative camera also follows the unit facing. WC3 entity state stores unit facing in radians, while camera rotation is authored in degrees, so the runtime first converts with `RAD2DEG` and then applies the same authored-camera convention (`viewangles.z = 90 - facingDegrees`). Clearing or replacing the target controller clears that inheritance state.

`PanCameraToWithZ` and `PanCameraToTimedWithZ` author a camera-target Z offset in
addition to X/Y. `G_RunClients()` interpolates that offset and the near/far clip
planes alongside the other camera values, and the WC3 player snapshot transports
all three to the client. The server camera sample remains exact; during map
registration the renderer builds a separate blurred terrain source, and the
client applies that source to the current camera XY while preserving the
server-authored terrain-relative Z offset. Terrain-derived camera Z is not
temporally smoothed. Camera setups support `CAMERA_FIELD_NEARZ`,
`CAMERA_FIELD_FARZ`, and `CAMERA_FIELD_ZOFFSET`; the `...WithZ` apply variants
override the setup Z offset with their explicit argument.
`CameraSetupApply(..., doPan=false, ...)` and
`CameraSetupApplyForceDuration(..., doPan=false, ...)` preserve the current
target position while still applying camera fields, matching Warsmash's
separation between setup fields and destination panning.

The current untimed `PanCameraTo` and `CameraSetupApply(..., panTimed=true)` still snap their target because OpenRealm does not yet retain Warcraft's default camera forward/strafe rates. `SetCameraField`, `AdjustCameraField`, `StopCamera`, and `SetCameraOrientController` remain placeholders. Keep those limitations explicit rather than inventing rates or semantics in the cinematic path.

`SetCameraQuickPosition` is not a camera movement native. It records Warcraft's spacebar/quick-position recall point for the local player. Assigning that point must leave `camera.state.position` unchanged; treating it like `SetCameraPosition` makes quest discovery and cinematic scripts unexpectedly jump the view when they only intend to set the later spacebar target.

The generic minimap client consumes Space while recent alert positions exist. When history is empty, the normal WC3 `SPACE` binding sends the game-owned `quickcamera` command; the server reads the authoritative scripted quick position and applies it through normal camera bounds/state handling. See [alerts-and-minimap-pings.md](alerts-and-minimap-pings.md).

Camera target bounds are map-global. `G_SpawnEntities()` initializes `level.camera_bounds` from the four W3I camera-bound points; `SetCameraBounds` replaces that one rectangle for every client. `GetCameraBoundMinX/Y` and `GetCameraBoundMaxX/Y` read it. Do not mutate `level.mapinfo->cameraBounds`: W3I remains immutable initial map metadata. Do not put the rectangle on `playerState_t`.

W3I stores its four integer camera complements in **left, right, bottom, top** order, while the JASS `CAMERA_MARGIN_*` selector constants are left, right, top, bottom. `mapCameraBounds_t.complement` deliberately follows the W3I on-disk order because `CM_ReadInfoInto()` reads the structure directly. The complements crop the complete W3E terrain to the playable rectangle; they are not camera margins themselves. `GetCameraMargin()` first reconstructs that playable rectangle from `CM_GetWorldBounds()` plus the complements, derives the axis-aligned default camera rectangle from the eight W3I camera-bound floats, and returns the gap between those two rectangles on the requested side. This matches Warsmash's `GetCameraMargin`: playable-map area and default camera bounds are separate inputs.

Do not implement `GetCameraMargin()` as `complement * TILE_SIZE`. World Editor generated `main` functions already start from playable-area edge constants and add/subtract `GetCameraMargin()` before calling `SetCameraBounds`; using the complement width there applies the unplayable terrain border a second time. Once `SetCameraBounds` became authoritative in OpenRealm, that old approximation manifested as the camera stopping roughly a viewport too early at the map edge. Warsmash's `GameCameraManager.applyVelocity()` also clamps its camera target directly to the rectangle supplied by `SetCameraBounds`, so the correct fix is to reproduce the native margin calculation rather than expanding the runtime clamp by a guessed viewport offset.

All server camera target writers use `G_ClampCameraPosition()` against `level.camera_bounds`. The client clamps predicted targets with `CM_GetWorldBounds()` — the loaded map, not a per-player snapshot. `CL_ParsePlayerInfo()` reclamps pending prediction to those world bounds before comparing it with the authoritative server origin.

The camera bounds constrain the **target**, not the visible frustum. Do not widen `SetCameraBounds` to compensate for a view that appears to stop too early. WC3's world projection must instead use the actual gameplay viewport above the command console. `V_RenderView()` assigns `{0, 0.22, 1, 0.76}` to both `viewDef.viewport` and `viewDef.scissor`; `Matrix4_getCameraMatrix()` derives aspect ratio from that viewport rather than the full window. Renderer screen rays (`R_LineForScreenPoint`) and drag-selection normalization use the same viewport, so ground picking, middle-dragging, minimap camera-footprint projection, and the visible world all agree. A full-window projection followed only by scissoring narrows the horizontal ground footprint and leaves the camera target vertically off-center inside the visible WC3 world area; near map edges this can look like an over-tight camera clamp even when the JASS bounds themselves are correct.

The August 30, 2026 viewport change (`9c22952`, `wc3: match retail camera viewport and bounds semantics`) also established a presentation contract for post-world overlays. `R_RenderView()` calls `R_RevertSettings()` before drawing 2D overhead bars, and `V_RenderView()` draws the drag-selection marquee after `re.RenderFrame()`, so both paths are back in full-window GL state even though their content belongs to the world. Those overlays must temporarily re-apply `viewDef.scissor` and then restore the full-window scissor before `SCR_DrawLayout()` draws the HUD. Do not move the WC3 HUD boundary into renderer constants or rely on opaque console art to hide world overlays; the client-authored `viewDef.scissor` remains the authoritative rectangular world boundary.

The classic console is not itself rectangular: the retained info/status panel, portrait/minimap region, build queue, and command-card buttons can protrude above the flat world-scissor bottom while still being authored HUD. Drag selection therefore has one additional client-side rule. `SCR_LayoutClampSelectionRect()` examines the visible retained layout frames that extend into the bottom console and constrains the marquee's moving corner before the rectangle is used for both drawing and `EntitiesInRect()`. This keeps the selection box out of transparent status/command-card art without changing the camera viewport or teaching the shared renderer Warcraft-specific button coordinates. Full-screen world games naturally skip this rule because their world scissor already reaches the bottom of the UI canvas. See [economy-and-unit-presentation.md](economy-and-unit-presentation.md) for overhead-bar presentation details.

Regression coverage:

```sh
make test-wc3-engine WC3_PATTERN='wc3_api.camera*'
make test
```

The focused JASS cases cover camera bounds, shortest-arc Euler interpolation
(including equivalent multi-turn pitch values), timed WithZ interpolation,
target-controller orientation inheritance, setup clip/Z fields, and `doPan`
destination ownership. The full test target additionally covers
`net.camera_clamp_uses_world_bounds`,
`net.playerstate_camera_render_fields_roundtrip`,
`net.playerinfo_copies_server_clip_planes`, and
`net.camera_prediction_reconciles_to_server_clamped_bound`. The server composes
the camera look-at into `playerState.vieworigin` (XY focus plus the retained
retail target reference and JASS Z-offset) and always sends `znear`/`zfar` with
`distance`, including spawn and `ResetToGameCamera` defaults
(`WC3_CAMERA_DEFAULT_FOV`/`DISTANCE`/`NEAR_Z`/`FAR_Z` in
`games/warcraft-3/common/ui_constants.h`). `CL_GameDefaultCamera` uses that
same set. The client copies that vec3 into the camera sample; it does not keep a
previous clip or invent 100/5000. It does not rebuild Z from the heightmap.
`viewangles` travel on the player snapshot; camera target bounds do not. Unused
WoW map metadata is carried by one map-info configstring. Do not add a WC3-only
`camera_render` field. Retain the existing cinematic cleanup tests because all
of this camera state is client-visible. Camera JASS regression tests run against
the deliberately minimal `games/warcraft-3/tests/resources-src/Scripts/common.j`;
when a test uses a `common.j` constant or native, add its real declaration/value
to that fixture. In particular, `GetCameraMargin` requires the integer
`CAMERA_MARGIN_LEFT/RIGHT/TOP/BOTTOM` selectors (`0/1/2/3`), while clip/Z tests
require the real `CAMERA_FIELD_FARZ`, `CAMERA_FIELD_ZOFFSET`, and
`CAMERA_FIELD_NEARZ` converted handles. Leaving those globals undefined passes
the wrong JASS value type to the native before the assertion can run.

Visual viewport-overlay verification must cover both archive modes because the HUD art can differ while the world boundary contract must not:

```sh
build/bin/openwarcraft3 -data 'data/Warcraft III' -roc +map 'Maps\Campaign\Human02.w3m' +com_frame_limit 1200
build/bin/openwarcraft3 -data 'data/Warcraft III' -tft +map 'Maps\Campaign\Human02.w3m' +com_frame_limit 1200
```

During each bounded run, drag a world selection marquee downward through the command console and select a living unit near the lower world edge. Overhead health/mana bars must stop at `viewDef.scissor`. The marquee must stop earlier wherever retained bottom-console frames protrude above that rectangular boundary, including the status/info panel and command-card/build-button area; no console pixel may reveal the marquee.

### Widescreen cinematic chrome

The ordinary gameplay HUD remains authored inside the centered `0.8 x 0.6` 4:3 safe area. Cinematic letterbox **chrome** is different: `CinematicTopBorder` and `CinematicBottomBorder` must cover the complete widened UI canvas while the portrait, speaker text, and dialogue retain their original safe-area coordinates. The server marks only those two backdrops with `UIFLAG_EXTEND_WIDESCREEN_X`; `SCR_LayoutRect()` then replaces the marked frame's horizontal rect with `x=0` and `w=SCR_UICanvasWidth()` after normal FDF anchor resolution. At 4:3 this is still exactly `0.8`, so the behavior is a no-op.

A 2880x1620 trace demonstrated the failure mode: canvas width was `1.06667`, HUD root was `x=0.13333,w=0.8`, and both cinematic borders resolved to `x=0.13333,w=0.8` with valid `human-options-menu-background.blp` and `human-cinematic-border.blp` textures. Therefore missing left/right cinematic fill is a geometry-policy issue, not missing art. Do not widen `CinematicPanel` itself: doing so would move safe-area portrait/dialogue anchors.

### Actor Presentation

`SetUnitScale(unit, x, y, z)` follows Warsmash's current compatibility behavior: the WC3 XYZ API is rendered as a uniform scale using the **X component**. Y/Z are consumed for JASS signature compatibility but are not independent axes in the current entity renderer. Do not use the Z argument as the uniform scale; campaign scripts commonly pass equal values, which can hide that mistake until custom cinematic scaling uses distinct components.

### Cinefilter

Full-screen overlay effects (fades, blurs) use `SetCineFilterTexture`/`SetCineFilterStartColor`/`SetCineFilterEndColor`/`SetCineFilterDuration`/`DisplayCineFilter`. The runtime interpolation is in `G_Cinefade()` which lerps between start/end alpha.

The client-side fade is physical-screen presentation, not centered 4:3 HUD content. `SCR_DrawLayout()` must cover `{ x=0, y=0, w=SCR_UICanvasWidth(), h=UI_BASE_HEIGHT }`; using a fixed legacy rectangle leaves part of the widened scene outside the fade at aspect ratios wider than 4:3. Keep this separate from `SCR_LayoutSceneRect()`, which intentionally returns the centered 0.8-wide Warcraft HUD root.

### Human02 Victory-Cinematic Runtime Findings

A September 2026 trace of the Human02 victory sequence showed the cinematic trigger chain itself continuing correctly through camera moves, sleeps, unit orders, dialogue, cleanup, and level transition. The highest-confidence functional gaps were narrower:

- `IssueImmediateOrder(..., "mirrorimage")` returned false, leaving the campaign's later illusion target null. `AOmi` now runs through the ordinary no-target spell pipeline, creates timed illusion copies, and publishes summon events so the campaign trigger can capture `GetSummonedUnit()`.
- scripted `holdposition` now routes through the same Hold Position state transition as the command card instead of returning false from `IssueImmediateOrder`.
- owner-only cinematic sounds and minimap pings must resolve an explicitly supplied client edict before comparing Warcraft player numbers to engine connection slots. The old slot-only lookup caused `owner unavailable` / `no client` failures even for the connected local player.
- `SetSoundVolume`, `SetSoundPosition`, and `AttachSoundToUnit` now feed the existing one-shot sound packet. MP3 dialogue decoding, stop/fade, volume groups, and thematic music are still separate audio gaps.

The same trace reported authored `.mdl` effects and `.tga` cinefilter masks as missing at the diagnostic lookup layer. Do not special-case those names in cinematic code: the renderer already retries `.mdl` as `.mdx` and missing `.tga` textures as `.blp`. A diagnostic that probes only the authored name can therefore report a false missing asset even when render-time fallback succeeds.
