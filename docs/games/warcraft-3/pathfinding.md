# WC3 Pathfinding And Harvest Reachability

## Contract

WC3 movement keeps target selection, static routing, and interaction behavior separate:

```text
order / behavior -> target + interaction range -> routing -> collision-aware step
```

`games/warcraft-3/game/g_ai.c` owns per-tick steering and local block-and-slide. `server/sv_routing.c` owns static pathmap line tests, connectivity queries, and cached flow fields. Harvest target selection remains in `skills/s_harvest_lumber.c`; the router never changes a tree target by itself.

Ground Move, Patrol, and Attack-move location orders are collision-size aware from destination selection through line tests, flow generation, and move-time validation. Generic interactions such as attack and repair still own their interaction ranges independently of routing. Harvest has an explicit collision split: Gold Mine approach and all resource-return legs use collision-sized **static-only** routing (live units ignored), while tree approach uses ordinary collision-sized generic movement.

### Harvest Worker Routing

Harvest/resource movement now follows the Warsmash-style collision contract directly: Gold Mine approach and all resource-return movement ignore **live units** while still respecting static pathing; tree approach uses ordinary generic unit collision. Building interaction routes use the worker's real collision radius, mover-owned bounded A* detours while shared fields rebuild, and footprint-aware near-side endpoints for Town Halls/Lumber Mills.

The movement validator is split accordingly: ordinary movement calls the full static + swept-unit check, while Harvest building legs exit after the static point/line checks. `SetUnitPathing(false)` remains the stronger existing override and still bypasses all collision. The Harvest policy does not mutate the shared pathmap, does not make buildings walkable, and does not alter Harvest/Return resource accounting.

Mine/drop-off interaction legs route with the **worker's collision radius** even though live-unit collision is disabled.  This matters when static pathing changes after an order starts: a newly constructed Farm invalidates the shared field, the bounded mover-owned A* immediately seeks a collision-sized detour while the replacement field is built, and the resulting field cannot choose point-only gaps that the Peasant's physical step validator will reject.  Return-resource legs do not use the blocked drop-off centre as their normal endpoint: they choose the innermost collision-safe ring around the authored footprint and select the point on that ring nearest the worker's current side.  The bounded mover path can detour around a Farm to that point without making a worker coming from the left circle around to the right side of a Town Hall or Lumber Mill.  Because the collision-sized path grid is cell-centred, that innermost legal route endpoint can still sit slightly outside the continuous footprint+one-step deposit threshold.  Reaching that exact near-side endpoint is therefore an explicit Return Resources handoff, matching the existing `flow_goal_reached` rasterization escape rather than making the worker bounce across the same staging cell forever.

Flow-generation handles remain monotonic across cache invalidation.  Route entities can retain an old generation after `CM_BakeStaticObstacles()`; recycling generation `1` after every rebuild could otherwise let that stale handle activate an unrelated newly built field.

The implementation reuses OpenRealm's direct-line, bounded-waypoint, and shared resumable flow routing rather than replacing the entire worker pathfinder. Warsmash itself keeps a longer per-unit waypoint path in `CBehaviorMove`; a full mover-owned path remains a later option if runtime cases still expose shared-field limitations.

## Walkable Bridges And Water

The WPM remains authoritative for horizontal movement: water cells with the no-walk bit are impassable, while the passable cells authored through a bridge form the only legal crossing lane. Bridge elevation is a separate game-side contract. `M_CheckGround()` starts with W3E terrain height, then checks the level's sparse registry of live `DestructableData.walkable` entities and uses the highest authored destructable Z whose pathing-texture footprint contains the unit. Dead, hidden/non-solid, and pathing-texture-less destructables do not supply ground.

Human01's river bridge confirms the split. Map object `LT05` (`WoodBridgeLarge45`) is `walkable=1`, `onWater=1`, has a 32x32 pathing texture, and is placed at `(1216, -960, -114)`. W3E terrain at its centre is `-170.8`, so terrain-only ground snapping puts a unit 56.8 world units below the deck even though WPM routing correctly accepts the crossing. Walkable surfaces are registered at map/runtime destructable spawn and unregistered on edict free; ground checks iterate bridges rather than every map entity.

Attack range against a building is measured from the attacker's collision edge to the building's authored no-walk footprint when `pathtex` is available. `skills/s_attack.c` therefore uses `CM_DistanceToPathingFootprint()` for building targets instead of requiring the attacker to enter weapon range of the blocked building centre. This is especially important for explicit force-fire on owned/friendly large buildings: centre-distance range checks make a melee unit orbit the footprint forever even though it is already beside a valid attack surface. Non-building targets retain the existing centre-distance attack check.

Lumber's unreachable-interior-tree detection is the narrower exception: `unit_changeangle_for_radius()` uses the Peasant's collision radius so Harvest can identify when the best legal approach to a blocked tree has genuinely been exhausted outside `HARVEST_RANGE`. Do not use that route-end signal for building interactions unless the route request also carries the behavior's interaction range.

Plain right-click movement is different from an interaction order: `move_selectlocation()` already assigns a collision-safe final waypoint, so `ai_move_walk()` may safely route that order with the mover's real collision radius. A distant temporary block does not cancel a plain move order. The unit keeps the order and retries local movement while the static route remains reachable; the existing near-goal settle rule is retained for an occupied final slot. If a completed collision-sized flow field reports the mover's component unreachable, the move may stop.

## Flow-Field Lifecycle

Game routing no longer uses the old lifetime quota of two synchronous whole-map flow-field bakes. That quota avoided repeated handheld stalls, but after it was spent a later uncached move order received generation 0 forever and generic steering fell back toward the raw target. A reachable order behind trees/buildings could therefore stop even though the static router could have found a route.

`CM_RequestHeatmapForRadius()` is the game-facing shared-cache miss path. A cache hit returns its generation immediately; a miss starts one resumable reverse shortest-path job and returns 0 until the job completes. `G_RunFrame()` advances that job after entity simulation through `CM_ProcessPathJobs()`. The default relaxation budget is 32,768 queue pops per frame and is runtime-tunable with:

```sh
+set wc3_path_work_budget 32768
```

The value is clamped to 256-65,536. This keeps SPFA relaxation bounded without permanently denying later destinations. Only one miss is built at a time; requests for other destinations retry after the active job completes. Static-pathing invalidation cancels the in-progress job along with cached generations.

Nearby detours do not wait for that whole field. `CM_FindPathWaypoint()` runs a bounded point-to-point A* accelerator for endpoints within 48 pathing cells, expands at most 2,048 nodes, and returns the farthest recovered path point with a collision-sized clear line from the mover. The mover retains that waypoint until it reaches it, the target changes, or static pathing invalidates the segment. A failed or out-of-envelope acceleration request falls back to the shared incremental field, so long routes remain frame-budgeted.

While a resumable request is pending, `unit_changeangle*()` leaves both `movement.flow_generation == 0` and `movement.flow_direct == false`. `unit_moveindirection()` treats that pair as "no heading resolved this tick" and does not commit a step. This shared guard is important: a caller must never turn a pending route into movement along the unit's stale facing.

Plain Move also keeps the stand presentation while that pair is clear. The order switches to walk only after direct steering or a completed flow field supplies a heading; starting the walk pose at order submission made the old facing look like an incorrect first turn during a long route build.

`CM_BuildHeatmapForRadius()` remains the synchronous API for tests/tools that explicitly require a completed field. Production movement goes through `M_RefreshHeatmap()` -> `CM_RequestHeatmapForRadius()`.

Production services the shared incremental build with 32,768 queue pops per 10 Hz server frame. A 256x256 open field therefore completes in at most two frames instead of the previous sixteen-frame (1.6 second) delay. Override `wc3_path_work_budget` for slower targets. Complete destination-rooted publication remains the long-route fallback; the bounded accelerator is what removes that publication delay from nearby obstacle detours.

`CM_BuildHeatmapForRadius()` and the resumable request path both key cached fields by adjusted target cell and mover collision radius. The flood and flow query use the same radius-expanded static pathability predicate as move-time terrain checks. The zero-radius `CM_BuildHeatmap()` wrapper remains for callers that intentionally route a point.

Flow vectors only descend to a strictly lower heatmap price for both collision-sized and radius-zero point fields. The adjusted goal cell therefore has a zero vector instead of pointing back out to a higher-cost neighbour. This matters for shared interaction routes such as Gold Mines and resource drop-offs: an outward point-flow at the adjusted cell makes every worker sharing that field orbit the same wrong location. Cached prices retain `INT_MAX` for cells that the completed field cannot reach. `CM_FlowReachedGoal(generation, x, y)` identifies the adjusted goal cell, while `CM_FlowCanReach(generation, x, y)` distinguishes a disconnected cell from a zero produced by interpolation near the goal.

Harvest interactions still own their final range/contact semantics. Gold Mine approach requests a collision-sized static route toward the Mine, ignores live units at steering/move time, and continues toward the real Mine after the adjusted route goal until the Mine footprint/contact check admits the worker. Because construction rebakes static pathing and invalidates cached fields, a Farm built across the lane causes a collision-sized rebuild; while the shared field is pending, the mover-owned bounded A* waypoint provides the local detour.

Return Resources uses a stronger endpoint contract. `CM_FindInnerApproachPointToFootprintForRadius()` marks pathmap cells near the authored footprint, chooses the **innermost collision-safe ring**, then uses distance from the worker only to select the near side of that ring. Gold and lumber return route to that point with static-only collision. If grid/radius quantization leaves the innermost legal cell a few world units outside the continuous footprint+step threshold, reaching the exact endpoint is accepted as the deposit handoff instead of bouncing toward the blocked building and back. Longer detours fall back to the shared collision-sized field. `CM_PathCellWorldSize()` supplies routing-grid scale only; it is not a gameplay range constant.

The approach mask stores a small footprint-proximity rank so the inner ring can be selected without rescanning every authored footprint pixel for every candidate. Do not replace it with a simple footprint bounding box: sparse and irregular pathing textures require distance to the actual blocked pixels.

## Retail Move Destination Behavior

Two defects explained the Human01 fence report and units getting stuck behind trees or towers:

1. `CM_LineIsWalkableForRadius()` used ordinary Bresenham stepping. A 45-degree step from one cell to the next checked only those two cells, so the direct shortcut accepted an `ox/xo` arrangement even though both cardinal side cells were blocked. The shortcut now requires both side cells to be legal, matching heatmap expansion and `compute_flow_at()`.
2. Location steering requested a point-sized route while `move_is_valid()` rejected positions using the unit collision radius. The field could therefore direct a unit through a gap that its body could not occupy. Move, Patrol, and Attack-move now use `self->collision` for the direct line and field; interaction behaviors retain radius zero.

When a clicked destination is in another static connected component, the destination-rooted field reports the mover cell unreachable. `CM_ClosestReachablePointForRadius(from, target, radius)` floods the mover component with the same radius and diagonal rules, then chooses its legal cell nearest the click. The location order retargets its private waypoint once and follows a normal field to that point. This avoids both failure modes of the old behavior: freezing at the order origin and sliding forever along the blocking wall.

Ordinary destination fields remain incremental and frame-budgeted. The mover-component flood is synchronous only after a completed destination field proves the click unreachable, so this exceptional recovery does not add input-time work to reachable orders.

The current router is now deliberately hybrid. Direct collision-sized lines handle open ground, bounded per-mover A* handles nearby static detours, destination-cached integration fields amortize long routes shared by groups, and local avoidance handles live units. This is closer to retail's split between mover-owned route state and a global pathing system without claiming its unrecovered accelerator implementation.

### Retail Game.dll path audit

The ROC demo `data/Warcraft3demo/Game.dll` (build 4486, SHA-256 `286823c37a1083e91f07d040e46a9df7af4c4952e01fcbba460589bd4e297654`) retains RTTI for `CAbilityMove`, `NIpse::CLrPathingSys`, and `NIpse::CLrPathingAcc`. `CAbilityMove` installs its vtable at `Game.dll+0x102898`. The path constructor at `+0x458040` initializes a roughly 0xb0-byte persistent object, including two 32-byte containers at `+0x2c` and `+0x4c`, coordinate/state fields, and a pathing-system pointer. Mover setup at `+0x466aa0` allocates and stores one such object. Submission at `+0x458670` resets route state and copies the requested coordinate into both current and destination fields.

The update at `+0x458930` checks flags at `+0x80`, can return a pending state from a countdown at `+0x8c`, invokes progression routines at `+0x457da0` and `+0x457f20`, and exposes multiple result states to the movement caller at `+0x4661d0`. `+0x457da0` appends 8-byte coordinate pairs to the object's route container. `+0x457f20` consults one of two global indexed arrays through a signed selector and a `-2` sentinel before advancing the route. Together with the separate `CLrPathingAcc` and `CLrPathingSys` types, this establishes persistent per-mover progress backed by global accelerated pathing data. It does not establish whether the accelerator is A*, hierarchical sectors, a portal graph, or another Blizzard-specific structure.

Group movement at `+0x46a130` and `+0x46a330` derives per-mover coordinates and path flags before updating each path object. Retail routing is therefore not a point-only line test followed by movement that independently rejects the unit footprint, nor is there evidence that every order waits for a complete destination-rooted map flood.

This supports the direction of commit `4bad783d`: using the mover's collision size consistently and resolving an
unreachable click to a legal endpoint are closer to retail's per-mover, adjusted-endpoint architecture than routing a
point toward an impossible destination. The binary does not establish that OpenRealm's bounded A*, nearest-cell flood,
SPFA integration field, four-slot cache policy, or exact `ox/xo` diagonal test matches Blizzard's algorithm. Treat the
accelerator as a behaviorally supported approximation: it reproduces immediate nearby route output and mover-owned
progress while retaining OpenRealm's group-friendly cache for long routes.

### Retail and OpenRealm algorithm outline

| Stage | Retail evidence | OpenRealm |
|---|---|---|
| Open ground | Route setup can retain or reset mover path state by destination and mode | Collision-sized Bresenham line; no search |
| Nearby detour | Persistent mover path object emits coordinate pairs; global accelerator is consulted | Bounded octile A* emits one smoothed, persistent waypoint |
| Long/shared route | Global `CLrPathingSys` and `CLrPathingAcc`; exact sharing policy unrecovered | Four LRU destination/radius integration fields, built backward with SPFA |
| Dynamic units | Per-mover path flags and updates | Swept-circle movement plus deterministic local avoidance; not baked into static routes |
| Scheduling | Countdown/pending and multiple result states prove resumable progress | A* is capped at 2,048 expansions; complete fields get a configurable per-frame queue budget |

The speed difference was primarily work selection. Before the accelerator, one nearby cache miss cleared every route
node, relaxed the complete reachable component, then copied one integer per map cell before movement could start. A
256x256 diagnostic trace printed `cells=65536` at both build start and publication. The accelerator touches only nodes
reached by the bounded A* and uses generation stamps instead of clearing its scratch array. Its contiguous node/heap
arrays usually leave a nearby search with a small L1/L2 working set, but no retail evidence identifies an explicit
"L2 cache" technique.

The same corner rule is applied to direct routing and movement steps: a diagonal
segment is rejected when either cardinal side of the crossed cell corner is
blocked. `CM_LineIsWalkableForRadius()` and `M_MoveIsValid()` therefore agree
with the flow flood instead of allowing a direct order or a long simulation step
to squeeze through a diagonal wall corner. With no loaded path map, line tests
remain permissive, matching the existing no-map movement behavior.

## Retail Lumber Fallback

Retail Warcraft III continues lumber gathering when the explicitly clicked tree is alive but buried inside an unreachable group of trees.

OpenRealm keeps the clicked tree authoritative while routing can still approach it. If the worker reaches the collision-sized flow field's adjusted goal but remains outside `HARVEST_RANGE`, or the active field has no route from the worker's component, Harvest treats that approach as failed and selects a replacement tree. The replacement search excludes the failed tree and prefers the nearest live tree with a directly reachable legal harvest approach; a tree already within `HARVEST_RANGE` is immediately eligible.

This fallback is gameplay behavior in `s_harvest_lumber.c`, not a pathfinder rule. Normal movement, attack, patrol, item pickup, and spells do not acquire a different target when routing fails.

Multiple Peasants may legally harvest the same tree. Harvest now keeps the closest direct legal chop point instead of pre-assigning angular lanes. Dynamic separation is handled by the resource-worker local avoidance policy: a worker blocked by same-direction resource traffic queues briefly, while crossing or persistently pinned traffic uses deterministic right-first bounded passing. Static flow fields remain shared and occupancy-free, and the final tree approach no longer scans all edicts to allocate or reserve lanes. See [worker-crowd-routing.md](worker-crowd-routing.md) for the Human02 simulation and policy contract.

## Confirmed August 2026 Regression

A Human02 handheld trace for a Peasant ordered to an interior tree showed the worker reaching the forest edge and oscillating indefinitely at roughly 352-358 world units from the target. Every tick reported `blocked_frames=0` and, after instrumentation was extended, `flow=0 flow_goal=0`.

Two routing defects originally combined to prevent Harvest from ever receiving a usable failure/exhaustion state:

1. The lumber direct-line gate used `CM_LineIsWalkable()` as a zero-radius point test while the actual movement step used `CM_PointIsPathableForRadius(..., self->collision)`. A line could therefore be declared clear even when the Peasant could not physically fit along it. The fix remains scoped to behavior contracts that can safely use a collision-sized route; gold-mine/building interactions complete at their own contact/range boundary rather than at a flow field's adjusted goal.
2. The legacy generic heatmap build cap could permanently deny later route fields. The current implementation removes that lifetime quota entirely and uses resumable game routing instead, so lumber and ordinary movement do not depend on which route misses happened earlier in the match.

A third defect made a reached flow goal unstable: `compute_flow_at()` blended reachable neighbours including equal/higher-cost cells, so an adjusted goal beside asymmetric blocked geometry could point outward. All fields now follow only lower prices; radius-zero interaction routing then hands the final approach back to the behavior at the adjusted route end.

Do not reintroduce a distance-only timeout around Harvest to hide these routing failures. Fix and expose the routing state first, then let Harvest decide whether to retarget.

## JASS repositioning: `SetUnitPosition` vs raw X/Y

`SetUnitPosition` and `SetUnitPositionLoc` are pathing-aware repositioning natives. Warsmash implements both through
`CUnit.setPointAndCheckUnstuck()`: it tests the requested point, then checks a deterministic 64-world-unit square spiral for up to
300 candidates against unit collision and movement pathing. If no candidate is legal, the requested point remains the fallback.

OpenRealm mirrors that contract in `G_FindUnitUnstuckPosition()` (`g_spawn.c`). The requested point is checked against
`CM_PointIsPathableForRadius()` and live same-layer collision circles before the spiral advances. Authored building/destructable
pathing is already baked into the static pathmap, so a script that requests a point inside a structure is displaced to the first
legal nearby candidate instead of being left occluded inside the structure. `SetUnitX` and `SetUnitY` intentionally remain raw
coordinate setters; do not route them through the unstuck search.

This distinction matters for campaign scripts. The Prologue01 Thrall investigation showed `Othr` alive and renderer-visible at the
scripted destination while a no-depth/white diagnostic exposed his geometry through a nearby structure. The old native assigned X/Y
directly, unlike Warsmash, so blocked scripted destinations could leave a unit inside authored building pathing.

## Diagnostics

Runtime Harvest logging is off by default:

```sh
+set wc3_harvest_path_debug 1
```

prints Harvest transitions and fallback reasons. Level 2 adds per-approach route state and reports when a requested tree field becomes ready:

```sh
+set wc3_harvest_path_debug 2
```

Lumber routing uses the `WC3_HARVEST_PATH` prefix. Gold-mine entry uses `WC3_GOLD_PATH`, and gold return/deposit uses `WC3_GOLD_RETURN`. For map-specific mine/model mismatches, level 2 also emits `WC3_GOLD_GEOMETRY`; level 3 adds the pathing-texture rows as `WC3_GOLD_FOOTPRINT`. Generic resumable routing does not emit per-build debug lines. A healthy interior-tree fallback should progress through a nonzero flow generation and then one of:

```text
fallback ... reason=route_goal_out_of_range
fallback ... reason=route_unreachable
fallback ... reason=movement_blocked
```

followed by `start` and `reached` for the replacement tree.

## Verification

Focused tests live in `games/warcraft-3/game/tests/t_pathfinding.c` and `t_movement.c`. They cover:

- cache separation by collision radius;
- resumable cache misses serialize without losing a later destination;
- collision-radius-aware line walkability;
- water rejection with an explicitly passable bridge lane;
- walkable-destructable deck elevation with terrain restoration outside its footprint;
- direct-line and flow rejection of diagonal `ox/xo` corner cuts;
- rejection of a corridor too narrow for the mover;
- collision-sized Move, Patrol, and Attack-move route selection;
- collision-sized Move routing around a long wall;
- exact reachable clicks and closest reachable points across a disconnected wall;
- collision-radius expansion of the closest reachable boundary;
- end-to-end settling at the nearest reachable point for a disconnected click;
- a zero outward vector at the flow goal;
- end-to-end lumber retarget from a buried clicked tree to a reachable edge tree;
- gold-mine entry through an authored blocking mine footprint;
- gold return/deposit at an authored Town Hall footprint corner;
- lumber return to a Town Hall through an authored blocking building footprint;
- a distant temporarily blocked plain move keeps its order alive while near-goal jitter still settles;
- `SetUnitPosition` / `SetUnitPositionLoc` use the Warsmash-style blocked-point unstuck spiral while `SetUnitX/Y` remain raw.

Run when validating locally:

make test-wc3-engine WC3_PATTERN='wc3_movement.lumber_*'
```

### Interaction-owned route endpoints

Generic radius-0 point fields are still used for mine entry, resource return, attack, and other behaviors whose real target centre may be blocked. Their flow vectors nevertheless strictly descend to the adjusted legal route endpoint. Once that endpoint is reached, `unit_changeangle()` exposes `flow_goal_reached` and steers toward the real entity target. The owning behavior decides what that means: attack/range behaviors continue using their range test, while Gold Mine entry/return may hand off immediately at the route goal or after Move's bounded near-goal settle detector proves a crowded worker has stopped making progress at the interaction edge. This keeps routing monotonic without turning a distant blocked route into a successful interaction.

### Shared SC2 movement consumers

SC2 and WC3 include the same `server/sv_routing.c` in their server worlds.
`CM_AccelerateRoute` retains the mover-owned waypoint; `CM_SlideRoute` is WC3's
bounded generic left/right deflection loop extracted from `unit_desired_heading`.
WC3 retains its speed-priority ring limit, resource-worker policy, collision
callbacks, and turn-rate handling. SC2 calls the shared search for blocked static
steps instead of repeatedly rejecting the same flow direction at a corner.
See [SC2 selection and control](../starcraft-2/selection-and-control.md) for the
separate snapshot-precision defect that made both ground and cinematic movement
appear to advance in whole cells.
