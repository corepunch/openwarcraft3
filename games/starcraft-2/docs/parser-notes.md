# Parser Notes

These notes translate the public format information into a practical OpenWarcraft3 loader plan. They are intentionally scoped to inspection and rendering experiments, not full StarCraft II gameplay parity.

## Suggested Loader Pipeline

1. Open `.SC2Map`/`.SC2Mod`/`.s2ma` as MPQ, or open `.SC2Components` as a directory-backed archive.
2. Build a file table with normalized slash handling.
3. Read cheap identity files first:
	- `DocumentHeader`, if present.
	- `MapInfo`.
	- locale `GameStrings.txt`.
	- minimap/loading image paths.
4. Parse map dimensions, bounds, tileset/theme, loading screen, and player slots from `MapInfo`.
5. Parse `Objects` for placed objects/resources/start locations when format coverage is sufficient.
6. Parse terrain texture metadata from `t3Terrain.xml`.
7. Parse binary terrain/pathing layers incrementally:
	- `t3CellFlags` for visualization and hole/cell inspection.
	- `t3SyncCliffLevel` and height maps for terrain shape.
	- `t3SyncPathingInfo` for movement/building pathing once decoded.
8. Parse `Base.SC2Data/GameData` catalogs only as needed for IDs referenced by objects/terrain.
9. Resolve dependencies and localized strings after local parsing works on simple maps.

## Archive Abstraction

Use the same discipline as the Warcraft III MPQ path:

- One archive abstraction should support MPQ-backed and directory-backed maps.
- Query paths with normalized `/` and `\` handling.
- Keep extracted data in memory or test fixtures; do not rely on local ignored asset dumps.
- Tests should use small committed fixtures rather than a developer's StarCraft II install.

## Data Ownership

StarCraft II-specific parsers belong under `games/starcraft-2/`. Shared MPQ/container code can live in the common archive layer only if it remains game-agnostic.

Do not put StarCraft II literals into engine code. Examples of game-specific data that should stay in the StarCraft II target:

- `MapInfo`
- `t3Terrain.xml`
- `Base.SC2Data`
- terrain catalog IDs
- M3 model/material policy
- SC2 trigger/Galaxy assumptions

## Binary Parsing Style

- Parse fixed-width integer fields with explicit little-endian reads.
- Avoid packed C structs for on-disk records with variable strings.
- Validate magic/version/dimensions before allocating arrays.
- Track byte offsets in diagnostics.
- Preserve unknown fields in dump output.
- Make dump tools useful before adding renderer behavior.

Recommended early diagnostics:

```text
sc2map: file=<path>
sc2map: archive files=<count>
MapInfo: version=<n> size=<w>x<h> bounds=<l,b,r,t> theme=<id> planet=<id>
MapInfo: players=<n>
t3CellFlags: version=<n> size=<w>x<h> counts[00]=... counts[01]=... counts[02]=... counts[03]=...
```

## Test Fixture Plan

Start with the smallest possible fixtures:

1. A tiny synthetic MPQ with a minimal `MapInfo` and `GameStrings.txt`.
2. A directory-backed `.SC2Components` fixture with the same files.
3. A fixture with `t3CellFlags` only.
4. A fixture with `Objects` and a few placed resources/start points.
5. Real-map compatibility tests only when data licensing and fixture size are acceptable.

The fixture rule from the repository instructions still applies: do not make tests depend on local retail data folders.

## Cross-Checking With Existing Tools

Use existing community tools as comparators:

- `sc2reader`: compare basic map metadata, localized strings, images, dimensions, camera bounds, tileset, player slots, and teams.
- StormLib or Ladik's MPQ Editor: compare archive listings and extracted bytes.
- SC2 Map Analyzer: compare terrain/pathing visualizations once `t3*` layers are parsed.

## Open Questions

- Exact modern `MapInfo` versions and field deltas across Wings of Liberty, Heart of the Swarm, Legacy of the Void, and current Arcade maps.
- Complete `Objects` schema and whether it is always text/XML-like for current maps.
- Exact dimensions and coordinate transforms between height, cliff, pathing, and render grids.
- Dependency load order across maps, mods, campaigns, and Arcade content.
- Locked/protected map behavior and whether some downloaded maps omit editor-useful content.
