/*
 * s_move.c — Move ability: ground movement orders for units.
 *
 * When a player right-clicks on empty ground, move_selectlocation() is called
 * on the server.  It creates a waypoint entity at the target position and
 * calls order_move() for each selected unit.
 *
 * order_move() sets the unit's goalentity to the waypoint and switches to the
 * movement state.  Each game frame, ai_move_walk() checks the remaining distance: if
 * the unit has arrived it switches to the stand (idle) state; otherwise it
 * rotates toward the goal and advances by one frame's worth of movement.
 *
 * Steering, collision-aware steps, route goals, and support heights are owned here.
