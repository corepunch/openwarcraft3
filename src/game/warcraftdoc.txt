Title: Detailed explanation of slk file in War3.mpq
Sending Station: BBS Shuimu Tsinghua Station (Fri Aug 22 14:50:03 2003), forward

The slk file is a special file for Excel in Office. There are 33 slk files in War3.mpq, listing almost all of them.
The use of map files, sound files and effects is a good reference. Among them, there are:
Splats\UberSplatData.slk
UI\SoundInfo\AbilitySounds.slk
UI\SoundInfo\AmbienceSounds.slk
UI\SoundInfo\AnimSounds.slk
UI\SoundInfo\UISounds.slk
UI\SoundInfo\UnitAckSounds.slk
UI\SoundInfo\UnitCombatSounds.slk
UI\SoundInfo\AnimLookups.slk
UI\SoundInfo\DialogSounds.slk
UI\SoundInfo\PortraitAnims.slk
UI\SoundInfo\MIDISounds.slk MIDI

Units\DestructableData.slk
Units\ItemData.slk
Units\UnitAbilities.slk
Units\UnitBalance.slk
Units\UnitData.slk
Units\UnitWeapons.slk
Units\UpgradeData.slk

Their uses will be explained in detail below (transparency or Alpha in the text refers to the Alpha operation in graphics, a kind of mixing
Combined method):

Doodads\Doodads.slk defines the properties of ground appendages in WC3.
The meaning of each column:
A doodID internal number
B category, if there is no description, it is determined by the accessory ID.
C tilesets fragment setting, shape mapping.
Whether D tilesetSpecific uses special fragments, 0 does not use.
E dir path
